there was to be a great battle between all the creatures of the earth and the birds of the air . news of it went abroad , and the son of the king of tethertown said that when the battle was fought he would be there to see it , and would bring back word who was to be king . but in spite of that , he was almost too late , and every fight had been fought save the last , which was between a snake and a great black raven . both struck hard , but in the end the snake proved the stronger , and would have twisted himself round the neck of the raven till he died had not the king 's son drawn his sword , and cut off the head of the snake at a single blow . and when the raven beheld that his enemy was dead , he was grateful , and said : ' for thy kindness to me this day , i will show thee a sight . so come up now on the root of my two wings . ' the king 's son did as he was bid , and before the raven stopped flying , they had passed over seven bens and seven glens and seven mountain moors . ' do you see that house yonder ? ' said the raven at last . ' go straight for it , for a sister of mine dwells there , and she will make you right welcome . and if she asks , " wert thou at the battle of the birds ? " answer that thou wert , and if she asks , " didst thou see my likeness ? " answer that thou sawest it , but be sure thou meetest me in the morning at this place . '
the king 's son followed what the raven told him and that night he had meat of each meat , and drink of each drink , warm water for his feet , and a soft bed to lie in . thus it happened the next day , and the next , but on the fourth meeting , instead of meeting the raven , in his place the king 's son found waiting for him the handsomest youth that ever was seen , with a bundle in his hand . ' is there a raven hereabouts ? ' asked the king 's son , and the youth answered : ' i am that raven , and i was delivered by thee from the spells that bound me , and in reward thou wilt get this bundle . go back by the road thou camest , and lie as before , a night in each house , but be careful not to unloose the bundle till thou art in the place wherein thou wouldst most wish to dwell . ' then the king 's son set out , and thus it happened as it had happened before , till he entered a thick wood near his father 's house . he had walked a long way and suddenly the bundle seemed to grow heavier ; first he put it down under a tree , and next he thought he would look at it .
the string was easy to untie , and the king 's son soon unfastened the bundle . what was it he saw there ? why , a great castle with an orchard all about it , and in the orchard fruit and flowers and birds of very kind . it was all ready for him to dwell in , but instead of being in the midst of the forest , he did wish he had left the bundle unloosed till he had reached the green valley close to his father 's palace . well , it was no use wishing , and with a sigh he glanced up , and beheld a huge giant coming towards him . ' bad is the place where thou hast built thy house , king 's son , ' said the giant . ' true ; it is not here that i wish to be , ' answered the king 's son . ' what reward wilt thou give me if i put it back in the bundle ? ' asked the giant . ' what reward dost thou ask ? ' answered the king 's son . ' the first boy thou hast when he is seven years old , ' said the giant . ' if i have a boy thou shalt get him , ' answered the king 's son , and as he spoke the castle and the orchard were tied up in the bundle again . ' now take thy road , and i will take mine , ' said the giant . ' and if thou forgettest thy promise , i will remember it . '
light of heart the king 's son went on his road , till he came to the green valley near his father 's palace . slowly he unloosed the bundle , fearing lest he should find nothing but a heap of stones or rags . but no ! all was as it had been before , and as he opened the castle door there stood within the most beautiful maiden that ever was seen . ' enter , king 's son , ' said she , ' all is ready , and we will be married at once , ' and so they were . the maiden proved a good wife , and the king 's son , now himself a king , was so happy that he forgot all about the giant . seven years and a day had gone by , when one morning , while standing on the ramparts , he beheld the giant striding towards the castle . then he remembered his promise , and remembered , too , that he had told the queen nothing about it . now he must tell her , and perhaps she might help him in his trouble . the queen listened in silence to his tale , and after he had finished , she only said : ' leave the matter between me and the giant , ' and as she spoke , the giant entered the hall and stood before them . ' bring out your son , ' cried he to the king , ' as you promised me seven years and a day since . '
the king glanced at his wife , who nodded , so he answered : ' let his mother first put him in order , ' and the queen left the hall , and took the cook 's son and dressed him in the prince 's clothes , and led him up to the giant , who held his hand , and together they went out along the road . they had not walked far when the giant stopped and stretched out a stick to the boy . ' if your father had that stick , what would he do with it ? ' asked he . ' if my father had that stick , he would beat the dogs and cats that steal the king 's meat , ' replied the boy . ' thou art the cook 's son ! ' cried the giant . ' go home to thy mother ' ; and turning his back he strode straight to the castle . ' if you seek to trick me this time , the highest stone will soon be the lowest , ' said he , and the king and queen trembled , but they could not bear to give up their boy . ' the butler 's son is the same age as ours , ' whispered the queen ; ' he will not know the difference , ' and she took the child and dressed him in the prince 's clothes , and the giant let him away along the road . before they had gone far he stopped , and held out a stick . ' if thy father had that rod , what would he do with it ? ' asked the giant . ' he would beat the dogs and cats that break the king 's glasses , ' answered the boy .
' thou art the son of the butler ! ' cried the giant . ' go home to thy mother ' ; and turning round he strode back angrily to the castle . ' bring out thy son at once , ' roared he , ' or the stone that is highest will be lowest , ' and this time the real prince was brought . but though his parents wept bitterly and fancied the child was suffering all kinds of dreadful things , the giant treated him like his own son , though he never allowed him to see his daughters . the boy grew to be a big boy , and one day the giant told him that he would have to amuse himself alone for many hours , as he had a journey to make . so the boy wandered to the top of the castle , where he had never been before . there he paused , for the sound of music broke upon his ears , and opening a door near him , he beheld a girl sitting by the window , holding a harp . ' haste and begone , i see the giant close at hand , ' she whispered hurriedly , ' but when he is asleep , return hither , for i would speak with thee . ' and the prince did as he was bid , and when midnight struck he crept back to the top of the castle . ' to - morrow , ' said the girl , who was the giant 's daughter , ' to - morrow thou wilt get the choice of my two sisters to marry , but thou must answer that thou wilt not take either , but only me . this will anger him greatly , for he wishes to betroth me to the son of the king of the green city , whom i like not at all . '
then they parted , and on the morrow , as the girl had said , the giant called his three daughters to him , and likewise the young prince to whom he spoke . ' now , o son of the king of tethertown , the time has come for us to part . choose one of my two elder daughters to wife , and thou shalt take her to your father 's house the day after the wedding . ' ' give me the youngest instead , ' replied the youth , and the giant 's face darkened as he heard him . ' three things must thou do first , ' said he . ' say on , i will do them , ' replied the prince , and the giant left the house , and bade him follow to the byre , where the cows were kept . ' for a hundred years no man has swept this byre , ' said the giant , ' but if by nightfall , when i reach home , thou has not cleaned it so that a golden apple can roll through it from end to end , thy blood shall pay for it . ' all day long the youth toiled , but he might as well have tried to empty the ocean . at length , when he was so tired he could hardly move , the giant 's youngest daughter stood in the doorway .
' lay down thy weariness , ' said she , and the king 's son , thinking he could only die once , sank on the floor at her bidding , and fell sound asleep . when he woke the girl had disappeared , and the byre was so clean that a golden apple could roll from end to end of it . he jumped up in surprise , and at that moment in came the giant . ' hast thou cleaned the byre , king 's son ? ' asked he . ' i have cleaned it , ' answered he . ' well , since thou wert so active to - day , to - morrow thou wilt thatch this byre with a feather from every different bird , or else thy blood shall pay for it , ' and he went out . before the sun was up , the youth took his bow and his quiver and set off to kill the birds . off to the moor he went , but never a bird was to be seen that day . at last he got so tired with running to and fro that he gave up heart . ' there is but one death i can die , ' thought he . then at midday came the giant 's daughter . ' thou art tired , king 's son ? ' asked she . ' i am , ' answered he ; ' all these hours have i wandered , and there fell but these two blackbirds , both of one colour . ' ' lay down thy weariness on the grass , ' said she , and he did as she bade him , and fell fast asleep .
when he woke the girl had disappeared , and he got up , and returned to the byre . as he drew near , he rubbed his eyes hard , thinking he was dreaming , for there it was , beautifully thatched , just as the giant had wished . at the door of the house he met the giant . ' hast thou thatched the byre , king 's son ? ' ' i have thatched it . ' ' well , since thou hast been so active to - day , i have something else for thee ! beside the loch thou seest over yonder there grows a fir tree . on the top of the fir tree is a magpie 's nest , and in the nest are five eggs . thou wilt bring me those eggs for breakfast , and if one is cracked or broken , thy blood shall pay for it . ' before it was light next day , the king 's son jumped out of bed and ran down to the loch . the tree was not hard to find , for the rising sun shone red on the trunk , which was five hundred feet from the ground to its first branch . time after time he walked round it , trying to find some knots , however small , where he could put his feet , but the bark was quite smooth , and he soon saw that if he was to reach the top at all , it must be by climbing up with his knees like a sailor . but then he was a king 's son and not a sailor , which made all the difference .
however , it was no use standing there staring at the fir , at least he must try to do his best , and try he did till his hands and knees were sore , for as soon as he had struggled up a few feet , he slid back again . once he climbed a little higher than before , and hope rose in his heart , then down he came with such force that his hands and knees smarted worse than ever . ' this is no time for stopping , ' said the voice of the giant 's daughter , as he leant against the trunk to recover his breath . ' alas ! i am no sooner up than down , ' answered he . ' try once more , ' said she , and she laid a finger against the tree and bade him put his foot on it . then she placed another finger a little higher up , and so on till he reached the top , where the magpie had built her nest . ' make haste now with the nest , ' she cried , ' for my father 's breath is burning my back , ' and down he scrambled as fast as he could , but the girl 's little finger had caught in a branch at the top , and she was obliged to leave it there . but she was too busy to pay heed to this , for the sun was getting high over the hills . ' listen to me , ' she said . ' this night my two sisters and i will be dressed in the same garments , and you will not know me . but when my father says ' go to thy wife , king 's son , ' come to the one whose right hand has no little finger . '
so he went and gave the eggs to the giant , who nodded his head . ' make ready for thy marriage , ' cried he , ' for the wedding shall take place this very night , and i will summon thy bride to greet thee . ' then his three daughters were sent for , and they all entered dressed in green silk of the same fashion , and with golden circlets round their heads . the king 's son looked from one to another . which was the youngest ? suddenly his eyes fell on the hand of the middle one , and there was no little finger . ' thou hast aimed well this time too , ' said the giant , as the king 's son laid his hand on her shoulder , ' but perhaps we may meet some other way ' ; and though he pretended to laugh , the bride saw a gleam in his eye which warned her of danger . the wedding took place that very night , and the hall was filled with giants and gentlemen , and they danced till the house shook from top to bottom . at last everyone grew tired , and the guests went away , and the king 's son and his bride were left alone .
' if we stay here till dawn my father will kill thee , ' she whispered , ' but thou art my husband and i will save thee , as i did before , ' and she cut an apple into nine pieces , and put two pieces at the head of the bed , and two pieces at the foot , and two pieces at the door of the kitchen , and two at the big door , and one outside the house . and when this was done , and she heard the giant snoring , she and the king 's son crept out softly and stole across to the stable , where she led out the blue - grey mare and jumped on its back , and her husband mounted behind her . not long after , the giant awoke . ' are you asleep ? ' asked he . ' not yet , ' answered the apple at the head of the bed , and the giant turned over , and soon was snoring as loudly as before . by and bye he called again . ' are you asleep ? ' ' not yet , ' said the apple at the foot of the bed , and the giant was satisfied . after a while , he called a third time , ' are you asleep ? ' ' not yet , ' replied the apple in the kitchen , but when in a few minutes , he put the question for the fourth time and received an answer from the apple outside the house door , he guessed what had happened , and ran to the room to look for himself . the bed was cold and empty !
' my father 's breath is burning my back , ' cried the girl , ' put thy hand into the ear of the mare , and whatever thou findest there , throw it behind thee . ' and in the mare 's ear there was a twig of sloe tree , and as he threw it behind him there sprung up twenty miles of thornwood so thick that scarce a weasel could go through it . and the giant , who was striding headlong forwards , got caught in it , and it pulled his hair and beard . ' this is one of my daughter 's tricks , ' he said to himself , ' but if i had my big axe and my wood - knife , i would not be long making a way through this , ' and off he went home and brought back the axe and the wood - knife . it took him but a short time to cut a road through the blackthorn , and then he laid the axe and the knife under a tree . ' i will leave them there till i return , ' he murmured to himself , but a hoodie crow , which was sitting on a branch above , heard him . ' if thou leavest them , ' said the hoodie , ' we will steal them . ' ' you will , ' answered the giant , ' and i must take them home . ' so he took them home , and started afresh on his journey . ' my father 's breath is burning my back , ' cried the girl at midday . ' put thy finger in the mare 's ear and throw behind thee whatever thou findest in it , ' and the king 's son found a splinter of grey stone , and threw it behind him , and in a twinkling twenty miles of solid rock lay between them and the giant .
' my daughter 's tricks are the hardest things that ever met me , ' said the giant , ' but if i had my lever and my crowbar , i would not be long in making my way through this rock also , ' but as he had got them , he had to go home and fetch them . then it took him but a short time to hew his way through the rock . ' i will leave the tools here , ' he murmured aloud when he had finished . ' if thou leavest them , we will steal them , ' said a hoodie who was perched on a stone above him , and the giant answered : ' steal them if thou wilt ; there is no time to go back . ' ' my father 's breath is burning my back , ' cried the girl ; ' look in the mare 's ear , king 's son , or we are lost , ' and he looked , and found a tiny bladder full of water , which he threw behind him , and it became a great lock . and the giant , who was striding on so fast , could not stop himself , and he walked right into the middle and was drowned .
the blue - grey mare galloped on like the wind , and the next day the king 's son came in sight of his father 's house . ' get down and go in , ' said the bride , ' and tell them that thou hast married me . but take heed that neither man nor beast kiss thee , for then thou wilt cease to remember me at all . ' ' i will do thy bidding , ' answered he , and left her at the gate . all who met him bade him welcome , and he charged his father and mother not to kiss him , but as he greeted them his old greyhound leapt on his neck , and kissed him on the mouth . and after that he did not remember the giant 's daughter .
all that day she sat on a well which was near the gate , waiting , waiting , but the king 's son never came . in the darkness she climbed up into an oak tree that shadowed the well , and there she lay all night , waiting , waiting . on the morrow , at midday , the wife of a shoemaker who dwelt near the well went to draw water for her husband to drink , and she saw the shadow of the girl in the tree , and thought it was her own shadow . ' how handsome i am , to be sure , ' said she , gazing into the well , and as she stopped to behold herself better , the jug struck against the stones and broke in pieces , and she was forced to return to her husband without the water , and this angered him . ' thou hast turned crazy , ' said he in wrath . ' go thou , my daughter , and fetch me a drink , ' and the girl went , and the same thing befell her as had befallen her mother . ' where is the water ? ' asked the shoemaker , when she came back , and as she held nothing save the handle of the jug he went to the well himself . he too saw the reflection of the woman in the tree , but looked up to discover whence it came , and there above him sat the most beautiful woman in the world . ' come down , ' he said , ' for a while thou canst stay in my house , ' and glad enough the girl was to come .
now the king of the country was about to marry , and the young men about the court thronged the shoemaker 's shop to buy fine shoes to wear at the wedding . ' thou hast a pretty daughter , ' said they when they beheld the girl sitting at work . ' pretty she is , ' answered the shoemaker , ' but no daughter of mine . ' ' i would give a hundred pounds to marry her , ' said one . ' and i , ' ' and i , ' cried the others . ' that is no business of mine , ' answered the shoemaker , and the young men bade him ask her if she would choose one of them for a husband , and to tell them on the morrow . then the shoemaker asked her , and the girl said that she would marry the one who would bring his purse with him . so the shoemaker hurried to the youth who had first spoken , and he came back , and after giving the shoemaker a hundred pounds for his news , he sought the girl , who was waiting for him . ' is it thou ? ' inquired she . ' i am thirsty , give me a drink from the well that is yonder . ' and he poured out the water , but he could not move from the place where he was ; and there he stayed till many hours had passed by . ' take away that foolish boy , ' cried the girl to the shoemaker at last , ' i am tired of him , ' and then suddenly he was able to walk , and betook himself to his home , but he did not tell the others what had happened to him .
next day there arrived one of the other young men , and in the evening , when the shoemaker had gone out and they were alone , she said to him , ' see if the latch is on the door . ' the young man hastened to do her bidding , but as soon as he touched the latch , his fingers stuck to it , and there he had to stay for many hours , till the shoemaker came back , and the girl let him go . hanging his head , he went home , but he told no one what had befallen him . then was the turn of the third man , and his foot remained fastened to the floor , till the girl unloosed it . and thankfully , he ran off , and was not seen looking behind him . ' take the purse of gold , ' said the girl to the shoemaker , ' i have no need of it , and it will better thee . ' and the shoemaker took it and told the girl he must carry the shoes for the wedding up to the castle . ' i would fain get a sight of the king 's son before he marries , ' sighed she . ' come with me , then , ' answered he ; ' the servants are all my friends , and they will let you stand in the passage down which the king 's son will pass , and all the company too . '
up they went to the castle , and when the young men saw the girl standing there , they led her into the hall where the banquet was laid out and poured her out some wine . she was just raising the glass to drink when a flame went up out of it , and out of the flame sprang two pigeons , one of gold and one of silver . they flew round and round the head of the girl , when three grains of barley fell on the floor , and the silver pigeon dived down , and swallowed them . ' if thou hadst remembered how i cleaned the byre , thou wouldst have given me my share , ' cooed the golden pigeon , and as he spoke three more grains fell , and the silver pigeon ate them as before . ' if thou hadst remembered how i thatched the byre , thou wouldst have given me my share , ' cooed the golden pigeon again ; and as he spoke three more grains fell , and for the third time they were eaten by the silver pigeon . ' if thou hadst remembered how i got the magpie 's nest , thou wouldst have given me my share , ' cooed the golden pigeon . then the king 's son understood that they had come to remind him of what he had forgotten , and his lost memory came back , and he knew his wife , and kissed her . but as the preparations had been made , it seemed a pity to waste them , so they were married a second time , and sat down to the wedding feast .
