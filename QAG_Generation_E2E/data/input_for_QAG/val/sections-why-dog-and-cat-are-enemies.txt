once upon a time there was a man and his wife and they had a ring of gold . it was a lucky ring , and whoever owned it always had enough to live on . but this they did not know , and hence sold the ring for a small sum . but no sooner was the ring gone than they began to grow poorer and poorer , and at last did not know when they would get their next meal . they had a dog and a cat , and these had to go hungry as well . then the two animals took counsel together as to how they might restore to their owners their former good fortune . at length the dog hit upon an idea .
" they must have the ring back again , " he said to the cat . the cat answered : " the ring has been carefully locked up in the chest , where no one can get at it . " " you must catch a mouse , " said the dog , " and the mouse must gnaw a hole in the chest and fetch out the ring . and if she does not want to , say that you will bite her to death , and you will see that she will do it . "
this advice pleased the cat , and she caught a mouse . then she wanted to go to the house in which stood the chest , and the dog came after . they came to a broad river . and since the cat could not swim , the dog took her on his back and swam across with her . then the cat carried the mouse to the house in which the chest stood . the mouse gnawed a hole in the chest , and fetched out the ring . the cat put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river , where the dog was waiting for her , and swam across with her . then they started out together for home , in order to bring the lucky ring to their master and mistress . but the dog could only run along the ground ; when there was a house in the way he always had to go around it . the cat , however , quickly climbed over the roof , and so she reached home long before the dog , and brought the ring to her master .
then her master said to his wife : " what a good creature the cat is ! we will always give her enough to eat and care for her as though she were our own child ! " but when the dog came home they beat him and scolded him , because he had not helped to bring home the ring again . and the cat sat by the fireplace , purred and said never a word . then the dog grew angry at the cat , because she had robbed him of his reward , and when he saw her he chased her and tried to seize her . and ever since that day cat and dog are enemies .
