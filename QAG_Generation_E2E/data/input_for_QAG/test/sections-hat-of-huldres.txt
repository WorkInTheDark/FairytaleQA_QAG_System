once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead , and a certain cottager was on his way to the wedding - feast . as he chanced to cross a field , he found a milk - strainer , such as are usually made of cows ' tails , and looking just like an old brown rag . he picked it up , for he thought it could be washed , and then he would give it to his wife for a dish - rag . but when he came to the house where they were celebrating the wedding , it seemed as though no one saw him . the bride and groom nodded to the rest of the guests , they spoke to them and poured for them ; but he got neither greeting nor drink . then the chief cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table ; but he was not asked , nor did he get anything to eat . for he did not care to sit down of his own accord when no one had asked him . at last he grew angry and thought : " i might as well go home , for not a soul pays a bit of attention to me here . " when he reached home , he said : " good evening , here i am back again . "
" for heaven 's sake , are you back again ? " asked his wife . " yes , there was no one there who paid any attention to me , or even so much as looked at me , " said the man , " and when people show me so little consideration , it seems as though i have nothing to look for there . " " but where are you ? i can hear you , but i can not see you ! " cried his wife .
the man was invisible , for what he had found was a huldre hat . " what are you talking about ? ca n't you see me ? have you lost your wits ? " asked the man . " there is an old hair strainer for you . i found it outside on the ground , " said he , and he threw it on the bench . and then his wife saw him ; but at the same moment the hat of the huldres disappeared , for he should only have loaned it , not given it away . now the man saw how everything had come about , and went back to the wedding - feast . and this time he was received in right friendly fashion , and was asked to drink , and to seat himself at the table .
