she was not yet strong enough to work , and they had no money left . <SEP> and so the years passed happily away till the boy was eight years old , but then the widow fell sick , and their little store of money melted gradually away . " i do n't know what we shall do for bread , " she said , kissing her boy with tears in her eyes , " for i am not yet strong enough to work , and we have no money left . " " but i can work , " answered the boy ; " and i 'm sure if i go to the squire up at the hall he will give me something to do . " at first the widow was reluctant to consent to this , since she loved to keep her child at her side , but finally , as nothing else could be done , she decided to let him go to see the squire .

she was too proud to allow her son to go to the great house in ragged clothes . <SEP> being too proud to allow her son to go to the great house in his ragged clothes , she made him a new suit out of a pretty blue dress she had herself worn in happier times , and when it was finished and the boy dressed in it , he looked as pretty as a prince in a fairy tale . for the bright blue jacket set off his curls to good advantage , and the color just matched the blue of his eyes . his trousers were blue , also , and she took the silver buckles from her own shoes and put them on his , that he might appear the finer . and then she brushed his curls and placed his big straw hat upon them and sent him away with a kiss to see the squire .
madge . <SEP> it so happened that the great man was walking in his garden with his daughter madge that morning , and was feeling in an especially happy mood , so that when he suddenly looked up and saw a little boy before him , he said , kindly , " well , my child , what can i do for you ? " " if you please , sir , " said the boy , bravely , although he was frightened at meeting the squire face to face , " i want you to give me some work to do , so that i can earn money . " " earn money ! " repeated the squire , " why do you wish to earn money ? " " to buy food for my mother , sir . we are very poor , and since she is no longer able to work for me i wish to work for her . " " but what can you do ? " asked the squire ; " you are too small to work in the fields . " " i could earn something , sir , could n't i ? "
his tone was so pleading . <SEP> his tone was so pleading that mistress madge was unable to resist it , and even the squire was touched . the young lady came forward and took the boy 's hand in her own , and pressing back his curls , she kissed his fair cheek . " you shall be our shepherd , " she said , pleasantly , " and keep the sheep out of the meadows and the cows from getting into the corn . you know , father , " she continued , turning to the squire , " it was only yesterday you said you must get a boy to tend the sheep , and this little boy can do it nicely . " " very well , " replied the squire , " it shall be as you say , and if he is attentive and watchful he will be able to save me a good bit of trouble and so really earn his money . " then he turned to the child and said , " come to me in the morning , my little man , and i will give you a silver horn to blow , that you may call the sheep and the cows whenever they go astray . what is your name ? "
shepherd . <SEP> " oh , never mind his name , papa ! " broke in the squire 's daughter ; " i shall call him little boy blue , since he is dressed in blue from head to foot , and his dress but matches his eyes . and you must give him a good wage , also , for surely no squire before ever had a prettier shepherd boy than this . " " very good , " said the squire , cheerfully , as he pinched his daughter 's rosy cheek ; " be watchful , little boy blue , and you shall be well paid . " then little boy blue thanked them both very sweetly and ran back over the hill and into the valley where his home lay nestled by the river - side , to tell the good news to his mother .

wept tears of joy . <SEP> the poor widow wept tears of joy when she heard his story , and smiled when he told her that his name was to be little boy blue . she knew the squire was a kind master and would be good to her darling son . early the next morning little boy blue was at the hall , and the squire 's steward gave him a new silver horn , that glistened brightly in the sunshine , and a golden cord to fasten it around his neck . and then he was given charge of the sheep and the cows , and told to keep them from straying into the meadowlands and the fields of grain . it was not hard work , but just suited to little boy blue 's age , and he was watchful and vigilant and made a very good shepherd boy indeed . his mother needed food no longer , for the squire paid her son liberally and the squire 's daughter made a favorite of the small shepherd and loved to hear the call of his silver horn echoing amongst the hills . even the sheep and the cows were fond of him , and always obeyed the sound of his horn ; therefore the squire 's corn thrived finely , and was never trampled .

very glad . <SEP> little boy blue was now very happy , and his mother was proud and contented and began to improve in health . after a few weeks she became strong enough to leave the cottage and walk a little in the fields each day ; but she could not go far , because her limbs were too feeble to support her long , so the most she could attempt was to walk as far as the stile to meet little boy blue as he came home from work in the evening . then she would lean on his shoulder and return to the cottage with him , and the boy was very glad he could thus support his darling mother and assist her faltering steps . but one day a great misfortune came upon them , since it is true that no life can be so happy but that sorrow will creep in to temper it .
her leg was broken . <SEP> little boy blue came homeward one evening very light of heart and whistled merrily as he walked , for he thought he should find his mother awaiting him at the stile and a good supper spread upon the table in the little cottage . but when he came to the stile his mother was not in sight , and in answer to his call a low moan of pain reached his ears . little boy blue sprang over the stile and found lying upon the ground his dear mother , her face white and drawn with suffering , and tears of anguish running down her cheeks . for she had slipped upon the stile and fallen , and her leg was broken !
take the boat and fetch the doctor from the village . <SEP> little boy blue came homeward one evening very light of heart and whistled merrily as he walked , for he thought he should find his mother awaiting him at the stile and a good supper spread upon the table in the little cottage . but when he came to the stile his mother was not in sight , and in answer to his call a low moan of pain reached his ears . little boy blue sprang over the stile and found lying upon the ground his dear mother , her face white and drawn with suffering , and tears of anguish running down her cheeks . for she had slipped upon the stile and fallen , and her leg was broken ! little boy blue ran to the cottage for water and bathed the poor woman 's face , and raised her head that she might drink . there were no neighbors , for the cottage stood all alone by the river , so the child was obliged to support his mother in his arms as best he could while she crawled painfully back to the cottage . fortunately , it was not far , and at last she was safely laid upon her bed . then little boy blue began to think what he should do next . " can i leave you alone while i go for the doctor , mamma ? " he asked , anxiously , as he held her clasped hands tightly in his two little ones . his mother drew him towards her and kissed him .
the cottage stood alone by the river . <SEP> little boy blue ran to the cottage for water and bathed the poor woman 's face , and raised her head that she might drink . there were no neighbors , for the cottage stood all alone by the river , so the child was obliged to support his mother in his arms as best he could while she crawled painfully back to the cottage . fortunately , it was not far , and at last she was safely laid upon her bed . then little boy blue began to think what he should do next .

pulled sturdily down the river until he passed the bend and came to the pretty village below . <SEP> " take the boat , dear , " she said , " and fetch the doctor from the village . i shall be patient till you return . " little boy blue rushed away to the river bank and unfastened the little boat ; and then he pulled sturdily down the river until he passed the bend and came to the pretty village below . when he had found the doctor and told of his mother 's misfortune , the good man promised to attend him at once , and very soon they were seated in the boat and on their way to the cottage .
take good care of his mother . <SEP> it was very dark by this time , but little boy blue knew every turn and bend in the river , and the doctor helped him pull at the oars , so that at last they came to the place where a faint light twinkled through the cottage window . they found the poor woman in much pain , but the doctor quickly set and bandaged her leg , and gave her some medicine to ease her suffering . it was nearly midnight when all was finished and the doctor was ready to start back to the village . " take good care of your mother , " he said to the boy , " and do n't worry about her , for it is not a bad break and the leg will mend nicely in time ; but she will be in bed many days , and you must nurse her as well as you are able . "
her misfortune will add to the expenses of living and they have a doctor to pay . <SEP> all through the night the boy sat by the bedside , bathing his mother 's fevered brow and ministering to her wants . and when the day broke she was resting easily and the pain had left her , and she told little boy blue he must go to his work . " for , " said she , " more than ever now we need the money you earn from the squire , as my misfortune will add to the expenses of living , and we have the doctor to pay . do not fear to leave me , for i shall rest quietly and sleep most of the time while you are away . "
little boy blue was fast asleep . <SEP> but he had not slept the whole night , and he was tired with his long watch at his mother 's bedside , and so in spite of himself the lashes would droop occasionally over his blue eyes , for he was only a child , and children feel the loss of sleep more than older people . still , little boy blue had no intention of sleeping while he was on duty , and bravely fought against the drowsiness that was creeping over him . the sun shone very hot that day , and he walked to the shady side of a big haystack and sat down upon the ground , leaning his back against the stack . the cows and sheep were quietly browsing near him , and he watched them earnestly for a time , listening to the singing of the birds , and the gentle tinkling of the bells upon the wethers , and the far - away songs of the reapers that the breeze brought to his ears . and before he knew it the blue eyes had closed fast , and the golden head lay back upon the hay , and little boy blue was fast asleep and dreaming that his mother was well again and had come to the stile to meet him . the sheep strayed near the edge of the meadow and paused , waiting for the warning sound of the horn . and the breeze carried the fragrance of the growing corn to the nostrils of the browsing cows and tempted them nearer and nearer to the forbidden feast . but the silver horn was silent , and before long the cows were feeding upon the squire 's pet cornfield and the sheep were enjoying themselves amidst the juicy grasses of the meadows . the squire himself was returning from a long , weary ride over his farms , and when he came to the cornfield and saw the cows trampling down the grain and feeding upon the golden stalks he was very angry . " little boy blue ! " he cried ; " ho ! little boy blue , come blow your horn ! " but there was no reply . he rode on a way and now discovered that the sheep were deep within the meadows , and that made him more angry still . " here , isaac , " he said to a farmer 's lad who chanced to pass by , " where is little boy blue ? " " he 's under the hay - stack , your honor , fast asleep ! " replied isaac with a grin , for he had passed that way and seen that the boy was lying asleep . " will you go and wake him ? " asked the squire ; " for he must drive out the sheep and the cows before they do more damage . "
strayed near the edge of the meadow . <SEP> the cows and sheep were quietly browsing near him , and he watched them earnestly for a time , listening to the singing of the birds , and the gentle tinkling of the bells upon the wethers , and the far - away songs of the reapers that the breeze brought to his ears . and before he knew it the blue eyes had closed fast , and the golden head lay back upon the hay , and little boy blue was fast asleep and dreaming that his mother was well again and had come to the stile to meet him . the sheep strayed near the edge of the meadow and paused , waiting for the warning sound of the horn . and the breeze carried the fragrance of the growing corn to the nostrils of the browsing cows and tempted them nearer and nearer to the forbidden feast . but the silver horn was silent , and before long the cows were feeding upon the squire 's pet cornfield and the sheep were enjoying themselves amidst the juicy grasses of the meadows .

happy . <SEP> " not i , " replied isaac , " if i wake him he 'll surely cry , for he is but a baby , and not fit to mind the sheep . but i myself will drive them out for your honor , " and away he ran to do so , thinking that now the squire would give him little boy blue 's place , and make him the shepherd boy , for isaac had long coveted the position . the squire 's daughter , hearing the angry tones of her father 's voice , now came out to see what was amiss , and when she heard that little boy blue had failed in his trust she was deeply grieved , for she had loved the child for his pretty ways . the squire dismounted from his horse and came to where the boy was lying . " awake ! " said he , shaking him by the shoulder , " and depart from my lands , for you have betrayed my trust , and let the sheep and the cows stray into the fields and meadows ! "
bade her own maid go to the widow and nurse her carefully until she recovered . <SEP> " in the cottage down by the river , " answered the child ; " and she is all alone , for there is no one near to help us in our trouble . " " come , " said mistress madge , rising to her feet and taking his hand ; " lead us to your home , and we will see if we can not assist your poor mother . " so the squire and his daughter and little boy blue all walked down to the little cottage , and the squire had a long talk with the poor widow . and that same day a big basket of dainties was sent to the cottage , and mistress madge bade her own maid go to the widow and nurse her carefully until she recovered .

a little country house back in the hills . <SEP> said old dschang : " i have only remained here because i thought you would long for your daughter . but since you are tired of us , i will be glad to go . i have a little country house back in the hills , and we will set out for it early to - morrow morning .

he was serious and dignified , and at the same time seemed youthfully fresh . <SEP> they crossed a hill . at the foot of the hill flowed a brook , and when they had crossed the brook they had to climb another hill . gradually the landscape changed . from the top of the hill could be seen a valley , level in the middle , surrounded by abrupt crags and shaded by green trees , among which houses and towers peeped forth . this was the country house of old dschang . before the village flowed a deep brook full of clear , blue water . they passed over a stone bridge and reached the gate . here flowers and trees grew in luxurious profusion , and peacocks and cranes flew about . from the distance could be heard the sound of flutes and of stringed instruments . crystal - clear tones rose to the clouds . a messenger in a purple robe received the guest at the gate and led him into a hall of surpassing splendor . strange fragrances filled the air , and there was a ringing of little bells of pearl . two maid - servants came forth to greet him , followed by two rows of beautiful girls in a long processional . after them a man in a flowing turban , clad in scarlet silk , with red slippers , came floating along . the guest saluted him . he was serious and dignified , and at the same time seemed youthfully fresh . at first we 's son did not recognize him , but when he looked more closely , why it was old dschang ! the latter said with a smile : " i am pleased that the long road to travel has not prevented your coming . your sister is just combing her hair . she will welcome you in a moment .

" a likely story ! go home to thy ash - pit , and stop speaking havers ; " and , taking his arm , he drew him to the place where his other brothers were waiting , and they all went home together . but all the time assipattle kept on saying that he meant to kill the stoorworm ; and at last his brothers became so angry at what they thought was mere bragging , that they picked up stones and pelted him so hard with them that at last he took to his heels and ran away from them . that evening the six brothers were threshing corn in the barn , and assipattle , as usual , was lying among the ashes thinking his own thoughts , when his mother came out and bade him run and tell the others to come in for their supper .

angry . <SEP> the boy did as he was bid , for he was a willing enough little fellow ; but when he entered the barn his brothers , in revenge for his having run away from them in the afternoon , set on him and pulled him down , and piled so much straw on top of him that , had his father not come from the house to see what they were all waiting for , he would , of a surety , have been smothered . but when , at supper - time , his mother was quarrelling with the other lads for what they had done , and saying to them that it was only cowards who set on bairns littler and younger than themselves , assipattle looked up from the bicker of porridge which he was supping .

he needed all his strength when he went to fight the giant stoorworm . <SEP> " vex not thyself , mother , " he said , " for i could have fought them all if i liked ; ay , and beaten them , too . " " why didst thou not essay it then ? " cried everybody at once . " because i knew that i would need all my strength when i go to fight the giant stoorworm , " replied assipattle gravely . and , as you may fancy , the others laughed louder than before .
they wanted to find another solution . <SEP> time passed , and every saturday seven lassies were thrown to the stoorworm , until at last it was felt that this state of things could not be allowed to go on any longer ; for if it did , there would soon be no maidens at all left in the country . so the elders met once more , and , after long consultation , it was agreed that the sorcerer should be summoned , and asked what his other remedy was .

sad . <SEP> when they heard this sentence a terrible stillness fell upon the council , and everyone covered his face with his hands , for no man dare look at the king . but although his dear daughter was as the apple of his eye , he was a just and righteous monarch , and he felt that it was not right that other fathers should have been forced to part with their daughters , in order to try and save the country , if his child was to be spared . so , after he had had speech with the princess , he stood up before the elders , and declared , with trembling voice , that both he and she were ready to make the sacrifice .

"
he listened to his parents ' argument . <SEP> now that night everybody at the farm went to bed betimes , for next morning the whole family was to set out early , to go to the top of the hill near the sea , to see the princess eaten by the stoorworm . all except assipattle , who was to be left at home to herd the geese . the lad was so vexed at this -- for he had great schemes in his head -- that he could not sleep . and as he lay tossing and tumbling about in his corner among the ashes , he heard his father and mother talking in the great box - bed . and , as he listened , he found that they were having an argument .
crept over to where his father 's clothes were , and took the goose 's windpipe out of the pocket of his coat , and slipped noiselessly out of the house . <SEP> assipattle was not tumbling about in the ashes now ; he was sitting up in the darkness , with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes . his opportunity had come at last , and he knew it . he waited patiently till their heavy breathing told him that his parents were asleep ; then he crept over to where his father 's clothes were , and took the goose 's windpipe out of the pocket of his coat , and slipped noiselessly out of the house . once he was out of it , he ran like lightning to the stable . he saddled and bridled go - swift , and threw a halter round her neck , and led her to the stable door . the good mare , unaccustomed to her new groom , pranced , and reared , and plunged ; but assipattle , knowing his father 's secret , clapped her once on the left shoulder , and she stood as still as a stone . then he mounted her , and gave her two claps on the right shoulder , and the good horse trotted off briskly , giving a loud neigh as she did so .

angry . <SEP> the unwonted sound , ringing out in the stillness of the night , roused the household , and the goodman and his six sons came tumbling down the wooden stairs , shouting to one another in confusion that someone was stealing go - swift . the farmer was the first to reach the door ; and when he saw , in the starlight , the vanishing form of his favourite steed , he cried at the top of his voice : " stop thief , ho ! go - swift , whoa ! " and when go - swift heard that she pulled up in a moment . all seemed lost , for the farmer and his sons could run very fast indeed , and it seemed to assipattle , sitting motionless on go - swift 's back , that they would very soon make up on him . but , luckily , he remembered the goose 's thrapple , and he pulled it out of his pocket and whistled through it . in an instant the good mare bounded forward , swift as the wind , and was over the hill and out of reach of its pursuers before they had taken ten steps more .
he was but a slim , unarmed youth , and the mester stoorworm was so big that men said it would reach the fourth part round the world . <SEP> day was dawning when the lad came within sight of the sea ; and there , in front of him , in the water , lay the enormous monster whom he had come so far to slay . anyone would have said that he was mad even to dream of making such an attempt , for he was but a slim , unarmed youth , and the mester stoorworm was so big that men said it would reach the fourth part round the world . and its tongue was jagged at the end like a fork , and with this fork it could sweep whatever it chose into its mouth , and devour it at its leisure . for all this , assipattle was not afraid , for he had the heart of a hero underneath his tattered garments . " i must be cautious , " he said to himself , " and do by my wits what i can not do by my strength . " he climbed down from his seat on go - swift 's back , and tethered the good steed to a tree , and walked on , looking well about him , till he came to a little cottage on the edge of a wood .

an iron pot . <SEP> the door was not locked , so he entered , and found its occupant , an old woman , fast asleep in bed . he did not disturb her , but he took down an iron pot from the shelf , and examined it closely . " this will serve my purpose , " he said ; " and surely the old dame would not grudge it if she knew it was to save the princess 's life . " then he lifted a live peat from the smouldering fire , and went his way . down at the water 's edge he found the king 's boat lying , guarded by a single boatman , with its sails set and its prow turned in the direction of the mester stoorworm .

he pretended he found gold . <SEP> " it 's a cold morning , " said assipattle . " art thou not well - nigh frozen sitting there ? if thou wilt come on shore , and run about , and warm thyself , i will get into the boat and guard it till thou returnest . " " a likely story , " replied the man . " and what would the king say if he were to come , as i expect every moment he will do , and find me playing myself on the sand , and his good boat left to a smatchet like thee ? twould be as much as my head is worth . " " as thou wilt , " answered assipattle carelessly , beginning to search among the rocks . " in the meantime , i must be looking for a wheen mussels to roast for my breakfast . " and after he had gathered the mussels , he began to make a hole in the sand to put the live peat in . the boatman watched him curiously , for he , too , was beginning to feel hungry . presently the lad gave a wild shriek , and jumped high in the air . " gold , gold ! " he cried . " by the name of thor , who would have looked to find gold here ? "
took down his sail , and pointed the prow of his boat straight at the monster 's mouth . <SEP> assipattle , sailing slowly over the sea , and watching the mester stoorworm intently , noticed that the terrible monster yawned occasionally , as if longing for his weekly feast . and as it yawned a great flood of sea - water went down its throat , and came out again at its huge gills . so the brave lad took down his sail , and pointed the prow of his boat straight at the monster 's mouth , and the next time it yawned he and his boat were sucked right in , and , like jonah , went straight down its throat into the dark regions inside its body . on and on the boat floated ; but as it went the water grew less , pouring out of the stoorworm 's gills , till at last it stuck , as it were , on dry land . and assipattle jumped out , his pot in his hand , and began to explore . presently he came to the huge creature 's liver , and having heard that the liver of a fish is full of oil , he made a hole in it and put in the live peat .

tossed itself to and fro , twisting and writhing . <SEP> the poor , distressed creature -- for it was now to be pitied , even although it was a great , cruel , awful mester stoorworm -- tossed itself to and fro , twisting and writhing . and as it tossed its awful head out of the water its tongue fell out , and struck the earth with such force that it made a great dent in it , into which the sea rushed . and that dent formed the crooked straits which now divide denmark from norway and sweden . then some of its teeth fell out and rested in the sea , and became the islands that we now call the orkney isles ; and a little afterwards some more teeth dropped out , and they became what we now call the shetland isles . after that the creature twisted itself into a great lump and died ; and this lump became the island of iceland ; and the fire which assipattle had kindled with his live peat still burns on underneath it , and that is why there are mountains which throw out fire in that chilly land .

made the stoorworm sick . <SEP> assipattle , sailing slowly over the sea , and watching the mester stoorworm intently , noticed that the terrible monster yawned occasionally , as if longing for his weekly feast . and as it yawned a great flood of sea - water went down its throat , and came out again at its huge gills . so the brave lad took down his sail , and pointed the prow of his boat straight at the monster 's mouth , and the next time it yawned he and his boat were sucked right in , and , like jonah , went straight down its throat into the dark regions inside its body . on and on the boat floated ; but as it went the water grew less , pouring out of the stoorworm 's gills , till at last it stuck , as it were , on dry land . and assipattle jumped out , his pot in his hand , and began to explore . presently he came to the huge creature 's liver , and having heard that the liver of a fish is full of oil , he made a hole in it and put in the live peat . woe 's me ! but there was a conflagration ! and assipattle just got back to his boat in time ; for the mester stoorworm , in its convulsions , threw the boat right out of its mouth again , and it was flung up , high and dry , on the bare land . the commotion in the sea was so terrible that the king and his daughter -- who by this time had come down to the shore dressed like a bride , in white , ready to be thrown to the monster -- and all his courtiers , and all the country - folk , were fain to take refuge on the hill top , out of harm 's way , and stand and see what happened next . and this was what happened next .
the king did not have his boat to fight . <SEP> when the king 's proclamation was made known throughout the neighbouring kingdoms , there was a fine stir among all the young gallants , for it seemed but a little thing to slay a sea - monster ; and a beautiful wife , a fertile kingdom , and a trusty sword are not to be won every day . so six - and - thirty champions arrived at the king 's palace , each hoping to gain the prize . but the king sent them all out to look at the giant stoorworm lying in the sea with its enormous mouth open , and when they saw it , twelve of them were seized with sudden illness , and twelve of them were so afraid that they took to their heels and ran , and never stopped till they reached their own countries ; and so only twelve returned to the king 's palace , and as for them , they were so downcast at the thought of the task that they had undertaken that they had no spirit left in them at all . and none of them dare try to kill the stoorworm ; so the three weeks passed slowly by , until the night before the day on which the princess was to be sacrificed . on that night the king , feeling that he must do something to entertain his guests , made a great supper for them . this was too much for the boatman . forgetting all about his head and the king , he jumped out of the boat , and , pushing assipattle aside , began to scrape among the sand with all his might . while he was doing so , assipattle seized his pot , jumped into the boat , pushed her off , and was half a mile out to sea before the outwitted man , who , needless to say , could find no gold , noticed what he was about . and , of course , he was very angry , and the old king was more angry still when he came down to the shore , attended by his nobles and carrying the great sword sickersnapper , in the vain hope that he , poor feeble old man that he was , might be able in some way to defeat the monster and save his daughter . but to make such an attempt was beyond his power now that his boat was gone . so he could only stand on the shore , along with the fast assembling crowd of his subjects , and watch what would befall . and this was what befell ! woe 's me ! but there was a conflagration ! and assipattle just got back to his boat in time ; for the mester stoorworm , in its convulsions , threw the boat right out of its mouth again , and it was flung up , high and dry , on the bare land . the commotion in the sea was so terrible that the king and his daughter -- who by this time had come down to the shore dressed like a bride , in white , ready to be thrown to the monster -- and all his courtiers , and all the country - folk , were fain to take refuge on the hill top , out of harm 's way , and stand and see what happened next . and this was what happened next .
tossed its awful head out of the water its tongue fell out , and struck the earth with such force . <SEP> the poor , distressed creature -- for it was now to be pitied , even although it was a great , cruel , awful mester stoorworm -- tossed itself to and fro , twisting and writhing . and as it tossed its awful head out of the water its tongue fell out , and struck the earth with such force that it made a great dent in it , into which the sea rushed . and that dent formed the crooked straits which now divide denmark from norway and sweden . then some of its teeth fell out and rested in the sea , and became the islands that we now call the orkney isles ; and a little afterwards some more teeth dropped out , and they became what we now call the shetland isles . after that the creature twisted itself into a great lump and died ; and this lump became the island of iceland ; and the fire which assipattle had kindled with his live peat still burns on underneath it , and that is why there are mountains which throw out fire in that chilly land .

she married the prince . <SEP> and when they looked , the bird had told the truth , for blood was dripping from the shoe . then all the maids and all the women who were at the castle had to try on the shoe , but it would fit none of them .

the king . <SEP> once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in love with a princess , but she could not marry anyone , because she was under an enchantment . so the king set out to seek a fairy , and asked what he could do to win the princess 's love . the fairy said to him : " you know that the princess has a great cat which she is very fond of . whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat 's tail is the man she is destined to marry .

" at last , however , he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out . so the king , without losing a moment , set his foot upon it heavily . with one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man , who , fixing his angry eyes upon the king , said : " you shall marry the princess because you have been able to break the enchantment , but i will have my revenge . you shall have a son , who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long , and if you ever tell anyone what i have just said to you , you shall vanish away instantly , and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again . " though the king was horribly afraid of the enchanter , he could not help laughing at this threat . " if my son has such a long nose as that , " he said to himself , " he must always see it or feel it ; at least , if he is not blind or without hands . "

" the king said to himself that this would not be very difficult , and he left the fairy , determined to grind the cat 's tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all . you may imagine that it was not long before he went to see the princess , and puss , as usual , marched in before him , arching his back . the king took a long step , and quite thought he had the tail under his foot , but the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air . and so it went on for eight days , till the king began to think that this fatal tail must be full of quicksilver - it was never still for a moment . at last , however , he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out . so the king , without losing a moment , set his foot upon it heavily . with one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man , who , fixing his angry eyes upon the king , said : " you shall marry the princess because you have been able to break the enchantment , but i will have my revenge . you shall have a son , who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long , and if you ever tell anyone what i have just said to you , you shall vanish away instantly , and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again .

the enchanter . <SEP> the prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news , and at once sent ambassadors to ask the dear little princess in marriage . the king , her father , gave his consent ; and prince hyacinth , who , in his anxiety to see the princess , had gone three leagues to meet her was just advancing to kiss her hand when , to the horror of all who stood by , the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning , and , snatching up the dear little princess , whirled her away out of their sight !
prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty . <SEP> when he grew sensible he learned history ; and whenever any great prince or beautiful princess was spoken of , his teachers took care to tell him that they had long noses . his room was hung with pictures , all of people with very large noses ; and the prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty , that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter ! when his twentieth birthday was passed the queen thought it was time that he should be married , so she commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see , and among the others was a picture of the dear little princess !
the enchanter wanted his revenge on the prince 's father . <SEP> at last , however , he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out . so the king , without losing a moment , set his foot upon it heavily . with one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man , who , fixing his angry eyes upon the king , said : " you shall marry the princess because you have been able to break the enchantment , but i will have my revenge . you shall have a son , who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long , and if you ever tell anyone what i have just said to you , you shall vanish away instantly , and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again .

a little old woman . <SEP> the prince was left quite unconsolable , and declared that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again , and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him , he mounted his horse and rode sadly away , letting the animal choose his own path . so it happened that he came presently to a great plain , across which he rode all day long without seeing a single house , and horse and rider were terribly hungry , when , as the night fell , the prince caught sight of a light , which seemed to shine from a cavern . he rode up to it , and saw a little old woman , who appeared to be at least a hundred years old . she put on her spectacles to look at prince hyacinth , but it was quite a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so very short .
he was the son of the old fairy 's best friend . <SEP> the prince and the fairy ( for that was who she was ) had no sooner looked at one another than they went into fits of laughter , and cried at the same moment , " oh , what a funny nose ! " " not so funny as your own , " said prince hyacinth to the fairy ; " but , madam , i beg you to leave the consideration of our noses - such as they are - and to be good enough to give me something to eat , for i am starving , and so is my poor horse . " " with all my heart , " said the fairy . " though your nose is so ridiculous you are , nevertheless , the son of my best friend . i loved your father as if he had been my brother . now he had a very handsome nose ! " " and pray what does mine lack ? " said the prince . " oh ! it does n't lack anything , " replied the fairy . " on the contrary quite , there is only too much of it . but never mind , one may be a very worthy man though his nose is too long . i was telling you that i was your father 's friend ; he often came to see me in the old times , and you must know that i was very pretty in those days ; at least , he used to say so . i should like to tell you of a conversation we had the last time i ever saw him . " " indeed , " said the prince , " when i have supped it will give me the greatest pleasure to hear it ; but consider , madam , i beg of you , that i have had nothing to eat to - day . " in an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters , and the old fairy , taking the dear little princess by the hand , said to the prince : " now , say if you are not very much obliged to me . much good it was for me to talk to you about your nose ! you would never have found out how extraordinary it was if it had n't hindered you from doing what you wanted to . you see how self - love keeps us from knowing our own defects of mind and body . our reason tries in vain to show them to us ; we refuse to see them till we find them in the way of our interests . " prince hyacinth , whose nose was now just like anyone 's else , did not fail to profit by the lesson he had received . he married the dear little princess , and they lived happily ever after .

a palace of crystal . <SEP> the old fairy , who wished to make him happy , at last hit upon a plan . she shut the dear little princess up in a palace of crystal , and put this palace down where the prince would not fail to find it . his joy at seeing the princess again was extreme , and he set to work with all his might to try to break her prison ; but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly . in despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the dear little princess , who , on her part , stretched out her hand that he might kiss it ; but turn which way he might , he never could raise it to his lips , for his long nose always prevented it . for the first time he realized how long it really was , and exclaimed : " well , it must be admitted that my nose is too long ! "
the queen thought it was time that he should be married . <SEP> when he grew sensible he learned history ; and whenever any great prince or beautiful princess was spoken of , his teachers took care to tell him that they had long noses . his room was hung with pictures , all of people with very large noses ; and the prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty , that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter ! when his twentieth birthday was passed the queen thought it was time that he should be married , so she commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see , and among the others was a picture of the dear little princess !
the dear little princess . <SEP> now , she was the daughter of a great king , and would some day possess several kingdoms herself ; but prince hyacinth had not a thought to spare for anything of that sort , he was so much struck with her beauty . the princess , whom he thought quite charming , had , however , a little saucy nose , which , in her face , was the prettiest thing possible , but it was a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers , who had got into such a habit of laughing at little noses that they sometimes found themselves laughing at hers before they had time to think ; but this did not do at all before the prince , who quite failed to see the joke , and actually banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully the dear little princess 's tiny nose !
he was quite satisfied with it . <SEP> " my dear prince , might i beg you to move a little more that way , for your nose casts such a shadow that i really can not see what i have on my plate . ah ! thanks . now let us speak of your father . when i went to his court he was only a little boy , but that is forty years ago , and i have been in this desolate place ever since . tell me what goes on nowadays ; are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever ? in my time one saw them at parties , theatres , balls , and promenades every day . dear me ! what a long nose you have ! i can not get used to it ! " " really , madam , " said the prince , " i wish you would leave off mentioning my nose . it can not matter to you what it is like . i am quite satisfied with it , and have no wish to have it shorter . one must take what is given one . " " now you are angry with me , my poor hyacinth , " said the fairy , " and i assure you that i did n't mean to vex you ; on the contrary , i wished to do you a service . however , though i really can not help your nose being a shock to me , i will try not to say anything about it . i will even try to think that you have an ordinary nose . to tell the truth , it would make three reasonable ones . "
the king set his foot upon its tail heavily . <SEP> at last , however , he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out . so the king , without losing a moment , set his foot upon it heavily . with one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man , who , fixing his angry eyes upon the king , said : " you shall marry the princess because you have been able to break the enchantment , but i will have my revenge . you shall have a son , who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long , and if you ever tell anyone what i have just said to you , you shall vanish away instantly , and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again . " though the king was horribly afraid of the enchanter , he could not help laughing at this threat . " if my son has such a long nose as that , " he said to himself , " he must always see it or feel it ; at least , if he is not blind or without hands . "
the prince admitted his nose was too long . <SEP> in an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters , and the old fairy , taking the dear little princess by the hand , said to the prince : " now , say if you are not very much obliged to me . much good it was for me to talk to you about your nose ! you would never have found out how extraordinary it was if it had n't hindered you from doing what you wanted to . you see how self - love keeps us from knowing our own defects of mind and body . our reason tries in vain to show them to us ; we refuse to see them till we find them in the way of our interests .

told the prince all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses . <SEP> the prince was brought up with great care ; and , as soon as he could speak , they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses . no one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own , and the courtiers , to get into favor with the queen , took to pulling their babies ' noses several times every day to make them grow long . but , do what they would , they were nothing by comparison with the prince 's .
the king could not ever tell anyone what that enchanter had just said to him . <SEP> at last , however , he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out . so the king , without losing a moment , set his foot upon it heavily . with one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man , who , fixing his angry eyes upon the king , said : " you shall marry the princess because you have been able to break the enchantment , but i will have my revenge . you shall have a son , who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long , and if you ever tell anyone what i have just said to you , you shall vanish away instantly , and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again .

" if my son has such a long nose as that , " he said to himself , " he must always see it or feel it ; at least , if he is not blind or without hands . " but , as the enchanter had vanished , he did not waste any more time in thinking , but went to seek the princess , who very soon consented to marry him . but after all , they had not been married very long when the king died , and the queen had nothing left to care for but her little son , who was called hyacinth . the little prince had large blue eyes , the prettiest eyes in the world , and a sweet little mouth , but , alas ! his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face . the queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose , but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked ; that it was a roman nose , and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large nose . the queen , who was devoted to her baby , was pleased with what they told her , and when she looked at hyacinth again , his nose certainly did not seem to her quite so large .

charcoal nils . <SEP> in the old days there lived on a headland that juts out into the northwestern corner of lake rasval , in the neighborhood of the linde mining - district , a charcoal - burner named nils , generally known as charcoal nils . he let a farm - hand attend to his little plot of land , and he himself made his home in the forest , where he chopped wood in the summer and burned it to charcoal in the winter . yet no matter how hard he struggled , his work was unblessed with reward , and no one ever spoke of him save as poor charcoal nils .

a strange woman . <SEP> one day , when he was on the opposite shore of the lake , near the gloomy harsberg , a strange woman came up to him , and asked whether he needed some one to help him with his charcoal burning .
by noon , there was enough wood for a new kiln . <SEP> " yes , indeed , " said he , " help would be welcome . " so she began to gather blocks of wood and tree - trunks , more than charcoal nils could have dragged together with his horse , and by noon there was enough wood for a new kiln . when evening came , she asked the charcoal - burner whether he were satisfied with the day 's work she had done , and if she were to come back the next day .

his wife looked after the children and they gave him no trouble . <SEP> so she became his wife and lived with him in the wood for three years . they had three children , yet this worried nils but little , seeing that she looked after them , and they gave him no trouble .
he would rap three times with his ax against an old pine - tree not far from it . <SEP> preoccupied with this and other thoughts , he forgot while returning to his kiln , that he had promised the strange woman at the very beginning , when she had first helped him , that , whenever he had been home and was returning to the kiln , he would rap three times with his ax against an old pine - tree not far from it . on this occasion , as we have said , he forgot the sign , and as a result he saw something that nearly robbed him of his wits .

their bushy tails which they dipped in snow . <SEP> as he drew near the kiln , he saw it all aflame , and around it stood the three children and their mother , and they were clearing out the kiln . they were pulling down and putting out so that flames , smoke and ashes whirled sky - high , but instead of the spruce - branches that were generally used to put out the fire , they had bushy tails which they dipped in the snow !

" yes , that shall come about , " said nils to console her , and turned back home to fetch a horse . but instead he went out on the headline of kallernas , on the eastern shore of lake rasval , where a wise man lived , and asked the latter what he should do .
on the ice . <SEP> the old man advised him to go home and hitch his horse to his charcoal - wagon , but to hitch the horse in such wise that there would be not a single loop either in the harness or traces . then he was to mount the horse and ride back to the kiln without stopping , have the troll - woman and her children get into the wagon , and at once drive out on the ice with them .
scared . <SEP> the charcoal - burner did as the old man told him , saddled his horse , paying strict attention that there were no loops in saddle or bridle , rode across the ice through the wood to his kiln , and told the troll - woman and her children to get in . then he quickly turned back through the wood , out on the ice , and there let his horse run as fast as he could . when he reached the middle of the lake , he saw a pack of wolves running along in the direction of aboda - land , at the northern end of the lake , and heading for the ice . then he tore the saddle - harness from the traces , so that the wagon with the troll - folk was left standing on the bare ice , and rode as fast as his horse could carry him for the opposite shore . when the trolls saw the wolves they began to scream .
the troll - woman calling on others for aid . <SEP> " turn back , turn back ! " cried the mother . " and if you will not for my sake , then at least do so for the sake of vipa ( peewee ) , your youngest daughter ! " but charcoal nils rode for the shore without looking back . then he heard the troll - woman calling on others for aid . " brother in the harsberg , sister in stripa , cousin in ringfels ; take the loop and pull ! "

kept a very sharp eye upon their growth , and the day he thought them ready , he did not fail to challenge them to a trial on his racing - ground . <SEP> his secret object in these friendly visits was to learn whether the young boys were getting old enough to run with him ; he kept a very sharp eye upon their growth , and the day he thought them ready , he did not fail to challenge them to a trial on his racing - ground . there was not a family in all that beautiful region which had not in this way been visited and thinned out ; and the manito had quite naturally come to be held in abhorrence by all the indian mothers in the country . it happened that there lived near him a poor widow woman , whose husband and seven sons he had made way with ; and she was now living with an only daughter , and a son of ten or twelve years old . this widow was very poor and feeble , and she suffered so much for lack of food and other comforts of the lodge , that she would have been glad to die , but for her daughter and her little son . the mudjee monedo had already visited her lodge to observe whether the boy was sufficiently grown to be challenged to the race ; and so crafty in his approaches and so soft in his manners was the monedo , that the mother feared that he would yet decoy the son and make way with him as he had done with his father and his seven brothers , in spite of all her struggles to save him .

a bank . <SEP> she had come to a bank , painted with flowers of every hue , and was reclining on its fragrant couch , when a bird , of red and deep - blue plumage softly blended , alighted on a branch near by , and began to pour forth its carol . it was a bird of strange character , such as she had never before seen . its first note was so delicious to the ear of minda , and it so pierced to her young heart , that she listened as she had never before to any mortal or heavenly sound . it seemed like the human voice , forbidden to speak , and uttering its language through this wild wood - chant with a mournful melody , as if it bewailed the lack of the power or the right to make itself more plainly intelligible . the voice of the bird rose and fell , and circled round and round , but whithersoever floated or spread out its notes , they seemed ever to have their center where minda sat ; and she looked with sad eyes into the sad eyes of the mournful bird , that sat in his red and deep - blue plumage just opposite to the flowery bank . the poor bird strove more and more with his voice , and seemed ever more and more anxiously to address his notes of lament to minda 's ear , till at last she could not refrain from saying , " what aileth thee , sad bird ?

" " no one , " she answered , " but my son ; he is just beginning to kill deer . " " no , no , " he retorted ; " some one is living with you . " " kaween , no indeed , " replied the widow ; " you are only making sport of my hapless condition . who do you think would come and trouble themselves about me ? " " very well , " answered the manito , " i will go ; but on such a day i will again visit you , and see who it is that furnishes the meat , and whether it is your son or not . "
to prepare certain pieces of meat , which he pointed out to her , together with two or three buds of the birch - tree , which he requested her to put in the pot . <SEP> he had no sooner left the lodge and got out of sight , than the son - in - law made his appearance with two more deer . on being made acquainted with the conduct of the manito , " very well , " he said , " i will be at home the next time , to see him . " both the mother and the wife urged monedowa to be aware of the manito . they made known to him all of his cruel courses , and assured him that no man could escape from his power . " no matter , " said monedowa ; " if he invites me to the race - ground , i will not be backward . what follows , may teach him , my mother , to show pity on the vanquished , and not to trample on the widow and those who are without fathers . " when the day of the visit of the manito arrived , monedowa told his wife to prepare certain pieces of meat , which he pointed out to her , together with two or three buds of the birch - tree , which he requested her to put in the pot . he directed also that the manito should be hospitably received , as if he had been just the kind - hearted old indian he professed to be . monedowa then dressed himself as a warrior , embellishing his visage with tints of red , to show that he was prepared for either war or peace .

pleased . <SEP> as soon as the mudjee monedo arrived , he eyed this strange warrior whom he had never seen before ; but he dissembled , as usual , and , with a gentle laugh , said to the widow , " did i not tell you that some one was staying with you , for i knew your son was too young to hunt . " the widow excused herself by saying that she did not think it necessary to tell him , inasmuch as he was a manito , and must have known before he asked . the manito was very pleasant with monedowa , and after much other discourse , in a gentle - spoken voice , he invited him to the racing - ground , saying it was a manly amusement , that he would have an excellent chance to meet there with other warriors , and that he should himself be pleased to run with him . monedowa would have excused himself , saying that he knew nothing of running . " why , " replied the mudjee monedo , trembling in every limb as he spoke , " do n't you see how old i look , while you are young and full of life . we must at least run a little to amuse others . " " be it so , then , " replied monedowa . " i will oblige you . i will go in the morning . " pleased with his crafty success , the manito would have now taken his leave , but he was pressed to remain and partake of their hospitality . the meal was immediately prepared . but one dish was used .
swallowed a grain of the birch - bud . <SEP> monedowa partook of it first , to show his guest that he need not fear , saying at the same time , " it is a feast , and as we seldom meet , we must eat all that is placed on the dish , as a mark of gratitude to the great spirit for permitting me to kill animals , and for the pleasure of seeing you , and partaking of it with you . " they ate and talked , on this and that , until they had nearly dispatched the meal , when the manito took up the dish and drank off the broth at a breath . on setting it down he immediately turned his head and commenced coughing with great violence . the old body in which he had disguised himself was well - nigh shaken in pieces , for he had , as monedowa expected , swallowed a grain of the birch - bud , and this , which relished to himself as being of the bird nature , greatly distressed the old manito , who partook of the character of an animal , or four - footed thing . he was at last put to such confusion of face by his constant coughing , that he was enforced to leave , saying , or rather hiccoughing as he left the lodge , that he should look for the young man at the racing - ground in the morning . when the morning came , monedowa was early astir , oiling his limbs and enameling his breast and arms with red and blue , resembling the plumage in which he had first appeared to minda . upon his brow he placed a tuft of feathers of the same shining tints .

minda . <SEP> by his invitation his wife , minda , the mother and her young son , attended monedowa to the manito 's racing - ground . the lodge of the manito stood upon a high ground , and near it stretched out a long row of other lodges , said to be possessed by wicked kindred of his , who shared in the spoils of his cruelty . as soon as the young hunter and his party approached , the inmates appeared at their lodge - doors and cried out : " we are visited . " at this cry , the mudjee monedo came forth and descended with his companions to the starting - post on the plain . from this the course could be seen , winding in a long girdle about the lake ; and as they were now all assembled , the old manito began to speak of the race , belted himself up and pointed to the post , which was an upright pillar of stone . " but before we start , " said the manito , " i wish it to be understood that when men run with me i make a wager , and i expect them to abide by it - life against life . " " very well - be it so , " answered monedowa . " we shall see whose head is to be dashed against the stone . " " we shall , " rejoined the mudjee monedo . " i am very old , but i shall try and make a run . " " very well , " again rejoined monedowa ; " i hope we shall both stand to our bargain . "

birds were faster than foxes . <SEP> " good ! " said the old manito ; and he at the same time cast a sly glance at the young hunter , and rolled his eyes toward where stood the pillar of stone . " i am ready , " said monedowa . the starting shout was given , and they set off at high speed , the manito leading , and monedowa pressing closely after . as he closed upon him , the old manito began to show his power , and changing himself into a fox he passed the young hunter with ease , and went leisurely along . monedowa now , with a glance upward , took the shape of the strange bird of red and deep - blue plumage , and with one flight , lighting at some distance ahead of the manito , resumed his mortal shape . when the mudjee monedo espied his competitor before him , " whoa ! whoa ! " he exclaimed ; " this is strange ; " and he immediately changed himself into a wolf , and sped past monedowa . as he galloped by , monedowa heard a noise from his throat , and he knew that he was still in distress from the birch - bud which he had swallowed at his mother - in - law 's lodge . monedowa again took wing , and , shooting into the air , he descended suddenly with great swiftness , and took the path far ahead of the old manito . as he passed the wolf he whispered in his ear : " my friend , is this the extent of your speed ? "

the buffalo . <SEP> the manito began to be troubled with bad forebodings , for , on looking ahead , he saw the young hunter in his own manly form , running along at leisure . the mudjee monedo , seeing the necessity of more speed , now passed monedowa in the shape of a deer . they were now far around the circle of the lake , and fast closing in upon the starting - post , when monedowa , putting on his red and blue plumage , glided along the air and alighted upon the track far in advance . to overtake him , the old manito assumed the shape of the buffalo ; and he pushed on with such long gallops that he was again the foremost on the course . the buffalo was the last change he could make , and it was in this form that he had most frequently conquered . the young hunter , once more a bird , in the act of passing the manito , saw his tongue lolling from his mouth with fatigue . " my friend , " said monedowa , " is this all your speed ? " the manito made no answer . monedowa had resumed his character of a hunter , and was within a run of the winning - post , when the wicked manito had nearly overtaken him .
raised a cry of fear and fled away in a body to some distant land . <SEP> " bakah ! bakah ! nejee ! " he called out to monedowa ; " stop , my friend , i wish to talk to you . " monedowa laughed aloud as he replied : " i will speak to you at the starting - post . when men run with me i make a wager , and i expect them to abide by it - life against life . " one more flight as the blue bird with red wings , and monedowa was so near to the goal that he could easily reach it in his mortal shape . shining in beauty , his face lighted up like the sky , with tinted arms and bosom gleaming in the sun , and the parti - colored plume on his brow waving in the wind . monedowa , cheered by a joyful shout from his own people , leaped to the post . the manito came on with fear in his face . " my friend , " he said , " spare my life ; " and then added , in a low voice , as if he would not that the others should hear it , " give me to live . " and he began to move off as if the request had been granted . " as you have done to others , " replied monedowa , " so shall it be done to you . " and seizing the wicked manito , he dashed him against the pillar of stone . his kindred , who were looking on in horror , raised a cry of fear and fled away in a body to some distant land , whence they have never returned .
he had done that for which he was sent . <SEP> the widow 's family left the scene , and when they had all come out into the open fields , they walked on together until they had reached the fragrant bank and the evergreen wood , where the daughter had first encountered her bird lover . monedowa turning to her , said : " my mother , here we must part . your daughter and myself must now leave you . the good spirit , moved with pity , has allowed me to be your friend . i have done that for which i was sent . i am permitted to take with me the one whom i love . i have found your daughter ever kind , gentle and just . she shall be my companion . the blessing of the good spirit be ever with you . farewell , my mother - my brother , farewell . " while the widow woman was still lost in wonder at these words , monedowa , and minda his wife , changed at the same moment , rose into the air , as beautiful birds , clothed in shining colors of red and blue .
he was allowed to take one person with him . <SEP> she had come to a bank , painted with flowers of every hue , and was reclining on its fragrant couch , when a bird , of red and deep - blue plumage softly blended , alighted on a branch near by , and began to pour forth its carol . it was a bird of strange character , such as she had never before seen . its first note was so delicious to the ear of minda , and it so pierced to her young heart , that she listened as she had never before to any mortal or heavenly sound . it seemed like the human voice , forbidden to speak , and uttering its language through this wild wood - chant with a mournful melody , as if it bewailed the lack of the power or the right to make itself more plainly intelligible . the voice of the bird rose and fell , and circled round and round , but whithersoever floated or spread out its notes , they seemed ever to have their center where minda sat ; and she looked with sad eyes into the sad eyes of the mournful bird , that sat in his red and deep - blue plumage just opposite to the flowery bank . the poor bird strove more and more with his voice , and seemed ever more and more anxiously to address his notes of lament to minda 's ear , till at last she could not refrain from saying , " what aileth thee , sad bird ? " as if he had but waited to be spoken to , the bird left his branch , and alighting upon the bank , smiled on minda , and , shaking his shining plumage , answered : " i am bound in this condition until a maiden shall accept me in marriage . i have wandered these groves and sung to many and many of the indian girls , but none ever heeded my voice till you . will you be mine ? " he added , and poured forth a flood of melody which sparkled and spread itself with its sweet murmurs over all the scene , and fairly entranced the young minda , who sat silent , as if she feared to break the charm by speech . the bird , approaching nearer , asked her , if she loved him , to get her mother 's consent to their marriage . " i shall be free then , " said the bird , " and you shall know me as i am . " minda lingered , and listened to the sweet voice of the bird in its own forest notes , or filling each pause with gentle human discourse ; questioning her as to her home , her family , and the little incidents of her daily life . she returned to the lodge later than usual , but she was too timid to speak to her mother of that which the bird had charged her . she returned again and again to the fragrant haunt in the wood ; and everyday she listened to the song and the discourse of her bird admirer with more pleasure , and he every day besought her to speak to her mother of the marriage . this she could not , however , muster heart and courage to do . the widow 's family left the scene , and when they had all come out into the open fields , they walked on together until they had reached the fragrant bank and the evergreen wood , where the daughter had first encountered her bird lover . monedowa turning to her , said : " my mother , here we must part . your daughter and myself must now leave you . the good spirit , moved with pity , has allowed me to be your friend . i have done that for which i was sent . i am permitted to take with me the one whom i love . i have found your daughter ever kind , gentle and just . she shall be my companion . the blessing of the good spirit be ever with you . farewell , my mother - my brother , farewell .

the manito killed their sons . <SEP> his secret object in these friendly visits was to learn whether the young boys were getting old enough to run with him ; he kept a very sharp eye upon their growth , and the day he thought them ready , he did not fail to challenge them to a trial on his racing - ground . there was not a family in all that beautiful region which had not in this way been visited and thinned out ; and the manito had quite naturally come to be held in abhorrence by all the indian mothers in the country . it happened that there lived near him a poor widow woman , whose husband and seven sons he had made way with ; and she was now living with an only daughter , and a son of ten or twelve years old . this widow was very poor and feeble , and she suffered so much for lack of food and other comforts of the lodge , that she would have been glad to die , but for her daughter and her little son . the mudjee monedo had already visited her lodge to observe whether the boy was sufficiently grown to be challenged to the race ; and so crafty in his approaches and so soft in his manners was the monedo , that the mother feared that he would yet decoy the son and make way with him as he had done with his father and his seven brothers , in spite of all her struggles to save him .
she wanted him to grow to be a good man . <SEP> and yet she strove with all her might to strengthen her son in every good course . she taught him , as best she could , what was becoming for the wise hunter and the brave warrior . she remembered and set before him all that she could recall of the skill and the craft of his father and his brothers who were lost . the widow woman also instructed her daughter in whatever could make her useful as a wife ; and in the leisure - time of the lodge , she gave her lessons in the art of working with the quills of porcupine , and bestowed on her such other accomplishments as should make her an ornament and a blessing to her husband 's household . the daughter , minda by name , was kind and obedient to her mother , and never failed in her duty . their lodge stood high up on the banks of a lake , which gave them a wide prospect of country , embellished with groves and open fields , which waved with the blue light of their long grass , and made , at all hours of sun and moon , a cheerful scene to look upon . across this beautiful prairie , minda had one morning made her way to gather dry limbs for their fire ; for she disdained no labor of the lodge . and while enjoying the sweetness of the air and the green beauty of the woods , she strolled far away .
the fragrant haunt in the wood . <SEP> as if he had but waited to be spoken to , the bird left his branch , and alighting upon the bank , smiled on minda , and , shaking his shining plumage , answered : " i am bound in this condition until a maiden shall accept me in marriage . i have wandered these groves and sung to many and many of the indian girls , but none ever heeded my voice till you . will you be mine ?

scared . <SEP> he had no sooner left the lodge and got out of sight , than the son - in - law made his appearance with two more deer . on being made acquainted with the conduct of the manito , " very well , " he said , " i will be at home the next time , to see him . " both the mother and the wife urged monedowa to be aware of the manito . they made known to him all of his cruel courses , and assured him that no man could escape from his power . " no matter , " said monedowa ; " if he invites me to the race - ground , i will not be backward . what follows , may teach him , my mother , to show pity on the vanquished , and not to trample on the widow and those who are without fathers . " when the day of the visit of the manito arrived , monedowa told his wife to prepare certain pieces of meat , which he pointed out to her , together with two or three buds of the birch - tree , which he requested her to put in the pot . he directed also that the manito should be hospitably received , as if he had been just the kind - hearted old indian he professed to be . monedowa then dressed himself as a warrior , embellishing his visage with tints of red , to show that he was prepared for either war or peace .
to kill him . <SEP> in a region of country where the forest and the prairie strived which should be the most beautiful - the open plain , with its free sunshine and winds and flowers , or the close wood , with its delicious twilight - walks and enamored haunts - there lived a wicked manito in the disguise of an old indian . although the country furnished an abundance of game , and whatever else a good heart could wish for , it was the study of this wicked genius to destroy such as fell into his hands . he made use of all his arts to decoy men into his power , for the purpose of killing them . the country had been once thickly peopled , but this mudjee monedo had so thinned it by his cruel practices , that he now lived almost solitary in the wilderness . the secret of his success lay in his great speed . he had the power to assume the shape of any four - footed creature , and it was his custom to challenge such as he sought to destroy , to run with him . he had a beaten path on which he ran , leading around a large lake , and he always ran around this circle so that the starting and the winning - post was the same . as soon as the mudjee monedo arrived , he eyed this strange warrior whom he had never seen before ; but he dissembled , as usual , and , with a gentle laugh , said to the widow , " did i not tell you that some one was staying with you , for i knew your son was too young to hunt . " the widow excused herself by saying that she did not think it necessary to tell him , inasmuch as he was a manito , and must have known before he asked . the manito was very pleasant with monedowa , and after much other discourse , in a gentle - spoken voice , he invited him to the racing - ground , saying it was a manly amusement , that he would have an excellent chance to meet there with other warriors , and that he should himself be pleased to run with him . monedowa would have excused himself , saying that he knew nothing of running . " why , " replied the mudjee monedo , trembling in every limb as he spoke , " do n't you see how old i look , while you are young and full of life . we must at least run a little to amuse others . " " be it so , then , " replied monedowa . " i will oblige you . i will go in the morning . " pleased with his crafty success , the manito would have now taken his leave , but he was pressed to remain and partake of their hospitality . the meal was immediately prepared . but one dish was used .

angry . <SEP> presently the fairies noticed him , and , instead of being angry at his boldness in entering their abode , as he expected that they would be , they seemed very pleased to see him , and invited him to a seat at the table . but by and by they grew rude and insolent , and jeered at him for being content to serve mere mortals , telling him that they saw everything that went on at the castle , and making fun of the old butler , whom the page loved with all his heart . and they laughed at the food he ate , saying that it was only fit for animals ; and when any fresh dainty was set on the table by the scarlet - clad pages , they would push the dish across to him , saying : " taste it , for you will not have the chance of tasting such things at the castle . " at last he could stand their teasing remarks no longer ; besides , he knew that if he wanted to secure the cup he must lose no time in doing so . so he suddenly stood up , and grasped the stem of it tightly in his hand . " i 'll drink to you all in water , " he cried , and instantly the ruby wine was turned to clear cold water . he raised the cup to his lips , but he did not drink from it . with a sudden jerk he threw the water over the candles , and instantly the room was in darkness . then , clasping the precious cup tightly in his arms , he sprang to the opening of the knowe , through which he could see the stars glimmering clearly . he was just in time , for it fell to with a crash behind him ; and soon he was speeding along the wet , dew - spangled moor , with the whole troop of fairies at his heels . they were wild with rage , and from the shrill shouts of fury which they uttered , the page knew well that , if they overtook him , he need expect no mercy at their hands . and his heart began to sink , for , fleet of foot though he was , he was no match for the fairy folk , who gained on him steadily .

a mysterious voice helped him . <SEP> all seemed lost , when a mysterious voice sounded out of the darkness : " if you would gain the castle door , keep to the black stones on the shore . " it was the voice of some poor mortal , who , for some reason or other , had been taken prisoner by the fairies -- who were really very malicious little folk -- and who did not want a like fate to befall the adventurous page - boy ; but the little fellow did not know this . he had once heard that if anyone walked on the wet sands , where the waves had come over them , the fairies could not touch him , and this mysterious sentence brought the saying into his mind .

a scholar . <SEP> once upon a time there was a scholar , who wandered away from his home and went to emmet village . there stood a house which was said to be haunted . yet it was beautifully situated and surrounded by a lovely garden . so the scholar hired it . one evening he was sitting over his books , when several hundred knights suddenly came galloping into the room . they were quite tiny , and their horses were about the size of flies . they had hunting falcons and dogs about as large as gnats and fleas . they came to his bed in the corner of the room , and there they held a great hunt , with bows and arrows : one could see it all quite plainly . they caught a tremendous quantity of birds and game , and all this game was no larger than little grains of rice .

the knights needed to guard the roads and carry messages . <SEP> when the hunt was over , in came a long procession with banners and standards . they wore swords at their side and bore spears in their hands , and came to a halt in the north - west corner of the room . they were followed by several hundred serving - men . these brought with them curtains and covers , tents and tent - poles , pots and kettles , cups and plates , tables and chairs . and after them some hundreds of other servants carried in all sorts of fine dishes , the best that land and water had to offer . and several hundred more ran to and fro without stopping , in order to guard the roads and carry messages .
a king . <SEP> the scholar gradually accustomed himself to the sight . although the men were so very small he could distinguish everything quite clearly . before long , a bright colored banner appeared . behind it rode a personage wearing a scarlet hat and garments of purple . he was surrounded by an escort of several thousands . before him went runners with whips and rods to clear the way . then a man wearing an iron helmet and with a golden ax in his hand cried out in a loud voice : " his highness is graciously pleased to look at the fish in the purple lake ! " whereupon the one who wore the scarlet hat got down from his horse , and , followed by a retinue of several hundred men , approached the saucer which the scholar used for his writing - ink . tents were put up on the edge of the saucer and a banquet was prepared . a great number of guests sat down to the table . musicians and dancers stood ready . there was a bright confusion of mingled garments of purple and scarlet , crimson and green . pipes and flutes , fiddles and cymbals sounded , and the dancers moved in the dance . the music was very faint , and yet its melodies could be clearly distinguished . all that was said , too , the table - talk and orders , questions and calls , could be quite distinctly heard .
the king said scholar spent his whole life toiling over his books and yet he remained poor and got nowhere . <SEP> then he ordered the head cook to cook the fish , and the most varied dishes were prepared with them . the odor of roasting fat and spices filled the whole room . and then the wearer of the scarlet hat in his arrogance , decided to amuse himself at the scholar 's expense . so he pointed to him and said : " i know nothing at all about the writings and customs of the saints and wise men , and still i am a king who is highly honored ! yonder scholar spends his whole life toiling over his books and yet he remains poor and gets nowhere . if he could make up his mind to serve me faithfully as one of my officials , i might allow him to partake of our meal . " this angered the scholar , and he took his book and struck at them . and they all scattered , wriggling and crawling out of the door . he followed them and dug up the earth in the place where they had disappeared . and there he found an ants ' nest as large as a barrel , in which countless green ants were wriggling around . so he built a large fire and smoked them out .

" you silly old man , " said she , " why did you not bring the large box ? just think what we have lost . we might have had twice as much silver and gold as this . you are certainly an old fool !

she was greedy and mean . <SEP> you see from this that the sparrow was a truthful bird , and the old woman ought to have been willing to forgive her at once when she asked her pardon so nicely . but not so . the old woman had never loved the sparrow , and had often quarreled with her husband for keeping what she called a dirty bird about the house , saying that it only made extra work for her . now she was only too delighted to have some cause of complaint against the pet . she scolded and even cursed the poor little bird for her bad behavior , and not content with using these harsh , unfeeling words , in a fit of rage she seized the sparrow - who all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head before the old woman , to show how sorry she was - and fetched the scissors and cut off the poor little bird 's tongue . the old man now wished that he had said nothing about the big box , but it was too late ; the greedy old woman , not contented with the good luck which had so unexpectedly befallen them and which she so little deserved , made up her mind , if possible , to get more . early the next morning she got up and made the old man describe the way to the sparrow 's house . when he saw what was in her mind he tried to keep her from going , but it was useless . she would not listen to one word he said . it is strange that the old woman did not feel ashamed of going to see the sparrow after the cruel way she had treated her in cutting off her tongue in a fit of rage . but her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else . it did not even enter her thoughts that the sparrows might be angry with her - as , indeed , they were - and might punish her for what she had done .
she made up her mind to get more . <SEP> the old man now wished that he had said nothing about the big box , but it was too late ; the greedy old woman , not contented with the good luck which had so unexpectedly befallen them and which she so little deserved , made up her mind , if possible , to get more . early the next morning she got up and made the old man describe the way to the sparrow 's house . when he saw what was in her mind he tried to keep her from going , but it was useless . she would not listen to one word he said . it is strange that the old woman did not feel ashamed of going to see the sparrow after the cruel way she had treated her in cutting off her tongue in a fit of rage . but her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else . it did not even enter her thoughts that the sparrows might be angry with her - as , indeed , they were - and might punish her for what she had done .

dislike . <SEP> ever since the lady sparrow had returned home in the sad plight in which they had first found her , weeping and bleeding from the mouth , her whole family and relations had done little else but speak of the cruelty of the old woman .

" they all loved the old man who was so kind and good and patient under all his troubles , but the old woman they hated , and they determined , if ever they had the chance , to punish her as she deserved . they had not long to wait . after walking for some hours the old woman had at last found the bamboo grove which she had made her husband carefully describe , and now she stood before it crying out : " where is the tongue - cut sparrow 's house ? where is the tongue - cut sparrow 's house ? "
hastened to the door and knocked loudly . <SEP> at last she saw the eaves of the house peeping out from amongst the bamboo foliage . she hastened to the door and knocked loudly . when the servants told the lady sparrow that her old mistress was at the door asking to see her , she was somewhat surprised at the unexpected visit , after all that had taken place , and she wondered not a little at the boldness of the old woman in venturing to come to the house . the lady sparrow , however , was a polite bird , and so she went out to greet the old woman , remembering that she had once been her mistress .

she was rude . <SEP> the old woman intended , however , to waste no time in words , she went right to the point , without the least shame , and said : " you need not trouble to entertain me as you did my old man . i have come myself to get the box which he so stupidly left behind . i shall soon take my leave if you will give me the big box - that is all i want ! " the lady sparrow at once consented , and told her servants to bring out the big box . the old woman eagerly seized it and hoisted it on her back , and without even stopping to thank the lady sparrow began to hurry homewards .
the old woman could not walk fast , much less run . <SEP> the box was so heavy that she could not walk fast , much less run , as she would have liked to do , so anxious was she to get home and see what was inside the box , but she had often to sit down and rest herself by the way . while she was staggering along under the heavy load , her desire to open the box became too great to be resisted . she could wait no longer , for she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small one her husband had received .

a number of horrible and frightful looking demons . <SEP> at last this greedy and selfish old woman put down the box by the wayside and opened it carefully , expecting to gloat her eyes on a mine of wealth . what she saw , however , so terrified her that she nearly lost her senses . as soon as she lifted the lid , a number of horrible and frightful looking demons bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her . not even in nightmares had she ever seen such horrible creatures as her much - coveted box contained . a demon with one huge eye right in the middle of its forehead came and glared at her , monsters with gaping mouths looked as if they would devour her , a huge snake coiled and hissed about her , and a big frog hopped and croaked towards her . the old woman had never been so frightened in her life , and ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her , glad to escape alive . when she reached home she fell to the floor and told her husband with tears all that had happened to her , and how she had been nearly killed by the demons in the box .

the giant 's garden . <SEP> every afternoon , as they were coming from school , the children used to go and play in the giant 's garden . it was a large lovely garden , with soft green grass . here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars , and there were twelve peach - trees that in the spring - time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl , and in the autumn bore rich fruit . the birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them .

tried to play on the road , used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over , and talk about the beautiful garden inside . <SEP> he was a very selfish giant . the poor children had now nowhere to play . they tried to play on the road , but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones , and they did not like it . they used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over , and talk about the beautiful garden inside . " how happy we were there , " they said to each other . then the spring came , and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds . only in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter . the birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children , and the trees forgot to blossom . once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass , but when it saw the notice - board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again , and went off to sleep . the only people who were pleased were the snow and the frost .
so glad . <SEP> what did he see ? he saw a most wonderful sight . through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in , and they were sitting in the branches of the trees . in every tree that he could see there was a little child . and the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms , and were waving their arms gently above the children 's heads . the birds were flying about and twittering with delight , and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing . it was a lovely scene , only in one corner it was still winter . it was the farthest corner of the garden , and in it was standing a little boy . he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree , and he was wandering all round it , crying bitterly . the poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow , and the north wind was blowing and roaring above it .

the children were n't there . <SEP> but the spring never came , nor the summer.the autumn gave golden fruit to every garden , but to the giant 's garden she gave none . " he is too selfish , " she said . so it was always winter there , and the north wind , and the hail , and the frost , and the snow danced about through the trees . one morning the giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music . it sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the king 's musicians passing by . it was really only a little linnet singing outside his window , but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world . then the hail stopped dancing over his head , and the north wind ceased roaring , and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement .

the kids were so frightened that they all ran away . <SEP> " climb up ! little boy , " said the tree , and it bent its branches down as low as it could ; but the boy was too tiny . and the giant 's heart melted as he looked out . " how selfish i have been !

" he was really very sorry for what he had done . so he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly , and went out into the garden . but when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away , and the garden became winter again . only the little boy did not run , for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming . and the giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand , and put him up into the tree .

the tree broke at once into blossom and the birds came and sang on it . <SEP> and the tree broke at once into blossom , and the birds came and sang on it , and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the giant 's neck , and kissed him . and the other children , when they saw that the giant was not wicked any longer , came running back , and with them came the spring . " it is your garden now , little children , " said the giant , and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall . and when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen . all day long they played , and in the evening they came to the giant to bid him good - bye . " but where is your little companion ? " he said : " the boy i put into the tree . " the giant loved him the best because he had kissed him . " we do n't know , " answered the children ; " he has gone away . "
the giant grew very old and feeble . <SEP> " you must tell him to be sure and come here to - morrow , " said the giant . but the children said that they did not know where he lived , and had never seen him before ; and the giant felt very sad . every afternoon , when school was over , the children came and played with the giant . but the little boy whom the giant loved was never seen again . the giant was very kind to all the children , yet he longed for his first little friend , and often spoke of him . " how i would like to see him ! " he used to say . years went over , and the giant grew very old and feeble . he could not play about any more , so he sat in a huge armchair , and watched the children at their games , and admired his garden .
the giant ran downstairs in great joy , and out into the garden . <SEP> " i have many beautiful flowers , " he said ; " but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all . " one winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing . he did not hate the winter now , for he knew that it was merely the spring asleep , and that the flowers were resting . suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder , and looked and looked . it certainly was a marvellous sight . in the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms . its branches were all golden , and silver fruit hung down from them , and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved . downstairs ran the giant in great joy , and out into the garden . he hastened across the grass , and came near to the child . and when he came quite close his face grew red with anger , and he said , " who hath dared to wound thee ? "
the little child . <SEP> for on the palms of the child 's hands were the prints of two nails , and the prints of two nails were on the little feet . " who hath dared to wound thee ? " cried the giant ; " tell me , that i may take my big sword and slay him . " " nay ! " answered the child ; " but these are the wounds of love . " " who art thou ? " said the giant , and a strange awe fell on him , and he knelt before the little child . and the child smiled on the giant , and said to him , " you let me play once in your garden , to - day you shall come with me to my garden , which is paradise . " and when the children ran in that afternoon , they found the giant lying dead under the tree , all covered with white blossoms .

he was not her real father . <SEP> in this hopeless state the winter passed . the snow and frost and the cold winds gradually gave place to the gentle warmth of spring . then the summer came , and the sun burned white and scorching in the heavens above and on the earth beneath , and still these faithful knights kept watch and waited . at the end of these long months they called out to the old bamboo - cutter and entreated him to have some mercy upon them and to show them the princess , but he answered only that as he was not her real father he could not insist on her obeying him against her wishes .
he lent a willing ear to their tale of love . <SEP> the old man lent a willing ear to their tale of love , for in his inmost heart he felt sorry for these faithful suitors and would have liked to see his lovely foster - daughter married to one of them . so he went in to princess moonlight and said reverently : " although you have always seemed to me to be a heavenly being , yet i have had the trouble of bringing you up as my own child and you have been glad of the protection of my roof . will you refuse to do as i wish ?

" all you say is very reasonable , " said the old man , " but what kind of men will you consent to see ? i do not call these five men who have waited on you for months , light - hearted . they have stood outside this house through the winter and the summer , often denying themselves food and sleep so that they may win you . what more can you demand ?

the stone bowl which had belonged to buddha . <SEP> princess moonlight then sent word to the first knight that she requested him to bring her the stone bowl which had belonged to buddha in india . the second knight was asked to go to the mountain of horai , said to be situated in the eastern sea , and to bring her a branch of the wonderful tree that grew on its summit . the roots of this tree were of silver , the trunk of gold , and the branches bore as fruit white jewels . the third knight was told to go to china and search for the fire - rat and to bring her its skin . the fourth knight was told to search for the dragon that carried on its head the stone radiating five colors and to bring the stone to her . the fifth knight was to find the swallow which carried a shell in its stomach and to bring the shell to her .
they were disheartened and disgusted at what seemed to them the impossibility of the tasks given to them . <SEP> the old man thought these very hard tasks and hesitated to carry the messages , but the princess would make no other conditions . so her commands were issued word for word to the five men who , when they heard what was required of them , were all disheartened and disgusted at what seemed to them the impossibility of the tasks given them and returned to their own homes in despair . but after a time , when they thought of the princess , the love in their hearts revived for her , and they resolved to make an attempt to get what she desired of them .

traveling was very difficult and full of danger . <SEP> the first knight sent word to the princess that he was starting out that day on the quest of buddha 's bowl , and he hoped soon to bring it to her . but he had not the courage to go all the way to india , for in those days traveling was very difficult and full of danger , so he went to one of the temples in kyoto and took a stone bowl from the altar there , paying the priest a large sum of money for it . he then wrapped it in a cloth of gold and , waiting quietly for three years , returned and carried it to the old man .

it did not shine at all . <SEP> princess moonlight wondered that the knight should have returned so soon . she took the bowl from its gold wrapping , expecting it to make the room full of light , but it did not shine at all , so she knew that it was a sham thing and not the true bowl of buddha . she returned it at once and refused to see him . the knight threw the bowl away and returned to his home in despair . he gave up now all hopes of ever winning the princess .
mount horai belonged to the land of fable and not fact . <SEP> the second knight told his parents that he needed change of air for his health , for he was ashamed to tell them that love for the princess moonlight was the real cause of his leaving them . he then left his home , at the same time sending word to the princess that he was setting out for mount horai in the hope of getting her a branch of the gold and silver tree which she so much wished to have . he only allowed his servants to accompany him half - way , and then sent them back . he reached the seashore and embarked on a small ship , and after sailing away for three days he landed and employed several carpenters to build him a house contrived in such a way that no one could get access to it . he then shut himself up with six skilled jewelers , and endeavored to make such a gold and silver branch as he thought would satisfy the princess as having come from the wonderful tree growing on mount horai . every one whom he had asked declared that mount horai belonged to the land of fable and not to fact .
took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if he were wearied and worn out with travel . <SEP> when the branch was finished , he took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if he were wearied and worn out with travel . he put the jeweled branch into a lacquer box and carried it to the bamboo - cutter , begging him to present it to the princess . the old man was quite deceived by the travel - stained appearance of the knight , and thought that he had only just returned from his long journey with the branch . so he tried to persuade the princess to consent to see the man . but she remained silent and looked very sad . the old man began to take out the branch and praised it as a wonderful treasure to be found nowhere in the whole land . then he spoke of the knight , how handsome and how brave he was to have undertaken a journey to so remote a place as the mount of horai .
she knew the second knight was lying . <SEP> the second knight told his parents that he needed change of air for his health , for he was ashamed to tell them that love for the princess moonlight was the real cause of his leaving them . he then left his home , at the same time sending word to the princess that he was setting out for mount horai in the hope of getting her a branch of the gold and silver tree which she so much wished to have . he only allowed his servants to accompany him half - way , and then sent them back . he reached the seashore and embarked on a small ship , and after sailing away for three days he landed and employed several carpenters to build him a house contrived in such a way that no one could get access to it . he then shut himself up with six skilled jewelers , and endeavored to make such a gold and silver branch as he thought would satisfy the princess as having come from the wonderful tree growing on mount horai . every one whom he had asked declared that mount horai belonged to the land of fable and not to fact . when the branch was finished , he took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if he were wearied and worn out with travel . he put the jeweled branch into a lacquer box and carried it to the bamboo - cutter , begging him to present it to the princess . the old man was quite deceived by the travel - stained appearance of the knight , and thought that he had only just returned from his long journey with the branch . so he tried to persuade the princess to consent to see the man . but she remained silent and looked very sad . the old man began to take out the branch and praised it as a wonderful treasure to be found nowhere in the whole land . then he spoke of the knight , how handsome and how brave he was to have undertaken a journey to so remote a place as the mount of horai .
the six jewelers sent in a petition to the princess to be paid for their labor . <SEP> just at this moment the six jewelers , who had been employed on the making of the branch , but not yet paid by the knight , arrived at the house and sent in a petition to the princess to be paid for their labor . they said that they had worked for over a thousand days making the branch of gold , with its silver twigs and its jeweled fruit , that was now presented to her by the knight , but as yet they had received nothing in payment . so this knight 's deception was thus found out , and the princess , glad of an escape from one more importunate suitor , was only too pleased to send back the branch . she called in the workmen and had them paid liberally , and they went away happy . but on the way home they were overtaken by the disappointed man , who beat them till they were nearly dead , for letting out the secret , and they barely escaped with their lives . the knight then returned home , raging in his heart ; and in despair of ever winning the princess gave up society and retired to a solitary life among the mountains .

he paid his friend in china to get it for him . <SEP> now the third knight had a friend in china , so he wrote to him to get the skin of the fire - rat . the virtue of any part of this animal was that no fire could harm it . he promised his friend any amount of money he liked to ask if only he could get him the desired article . as soon as the news came that the ship on which his friend had sailed home had come into port , he rode seven days on horseback to meet him . he handed his friend a large sum of money , and received the fire - rat 's skin . when he reached home he put it carefully in a box and sent it in to the princess while he waited outside for her answer .
his friend did not get him the real fire - rat . <SEP> now the third knight had a friend in china , so he wrote to him to get the skin of the fire - rat . the virtue of any part of this animal was that no fire could harm it . he promised his friend any amount of money he liked to ask if only he could get him the desired article . as soon as the news came that the ship on which his friend had sailed home had come into port , he rode seven days on horseback to meet him . he handed his friend a large sum of money , and received the fire - rat 's skin . when he reached home he put it carefully in a box and sent it in to the princess while he waited outside for her answer . the bamboo - cutter took the box from the knight and , as usual , carried it in to her and tried to coax her to see the knight at once , but princess moonlight refused , saying that she must first put the skin to test by putting it into the fire . if it were the real thing it would not burn . so she took off the crape wrapper and opened the box , and then threw the skin into the fire . the skin crackled and burnt up at once , and the princess knew that this man also had not fulfilled his word . so the third knight failed also . now the fourth knight was no more enterprising than the rest . instead of starting out on the quest of the dragon bearing on its head the five - color - radiating jewel , he called all his servants together and gave them the order to seek for it far and wide in japan and in china , and he strictly forbade any of them to return till they had found it .
they considered it impossible . <SEP> his numerous retainers and servants started out in different directions , with no intention , however , of obeying what they considered an impossible order . they simply took a holiday , went to pleasant country places together , and grumbled at their master 's unreasonableness . the knight meanwhile , thinking that his retainers could not fail to find the jewel , repaired to his house , and fitted it up beautifully for the reception of the princess , he felt so sure of winning her . one year passed away in weary waiting , and still his men did not return with the dragon - jewel . the knight became desperate . he could wait no longer , so taking with him only two men he hired a ship and commanded the captain to go in search of the dragon ; the captain and the sailors refused to undertake what they said was an absurd search , but the knight compelled them at last to put out to sea .

sent messengers with a letter inviting him to his house . <SEP> when they had been but a few days out they encountered a great storm which lasted so long that , by the time its fury abated , the knight had determined to give up the hunt of the dragon . they were at last blown on shore , for navigation was primitive in those days . worn out with his travels and anxiety , the fourth suitor gave himself up to rest . he had caught a very heavy cold , and had to go to bed with a swollen face . the governor of the place , hearing of his plight , sent messengers with a letter inviting him to his house . while he was there thinking over all his troubles , his love for the princess turned to anger , and he blamed her for all the hardships he had undergone . he thought that it was quite probable she had wished to kill him so that she might be rid of him , and in order to carry out her wish had sent him upon his impossible quest .
he wanted to make her one of the ladies - in - waiting . <SEP> at this point all the servants he had sent out to find the jewel came to see him , and were surprised to find praise instead of displeasure awaiting them . their master told them that he was heartily sick of adventure , and said that he never intended to go near the princess 's house again in the future . like all the rest , the fifth knight failed in his quest - he could not find the swallow 's shell . by this time the fame of princess moonlight 's beauty had reached the ears of the emperor , and he sent one of the court ladies to see if she were really as lovely as report said ; if so he would summon her to the palace and make her one of the ladies - in - waiting .
vanish from the earth . <SEP> when the court lady arrived , in spite of her father 's entreaties , princess moonlight refused to see her . the imperial messenger insisted , saying it was the emperor 's order . then princess moonlight told the old man that if she was forced to go to the palace in obedience to the emperor 's order , she would vanish from the earth . when the emperor was told of her persistence in refusing to obey his summons , and that if pressed to obey she would disappear altogether from sight , he determined to go and see her . so he planned to go on a hunting excursion in the neighborhood of the bamboo - cutter 's house , and see the princess himself . he sent word to the old man of his intention , and he received consent to the scheme . the next day the emperor set out with his retinue , which he soon managed to outride . he found the bamboo - cutter 's house and dismounted . he then entered the house and went straight to where the princess was sitting with her attendant maidens .
she did not want to be seen . <SEP> never had he seen any one so wonderfully beautiful , and he could not but look at her , for she was more lovely than any human being as she shone in her own soft radiance . when princess moonlight became aware that a stranger was looking at her she tried to escape from the room , but the emperor caught her and begged her to listen to what he had to say . her only answer was to hide her face in her sleeves . the emperor fell deeply in love with her , and begged her to come to the court , where he would give her a position of honor and everything she could wish for . he was about to send for one of the imperial palanquins to take her back with him at once , saying that her grace and beauty should adorn a court , and not be hidden in a bamboo - cutter 's cottage .
leave her free . <SEP> but the princess stopped him . she said that if she were forced to go to the palace she would turn at once into a shadow , and even as she spoke she began to lose her form . her figure faded from his sight while he looked . the emperor then promised to leave her free if only she would resume her former shape , which she did .
any one on this earth . <SEP> it was now time for him to return , for his retinue would be wondering what had happened to their royal master when they missed him for so long . so he bade her good - by , and left the house with a sad heart . princess moonlight was for him the most beautiful woman in the world ; all others were dark beside her , and he thought of her night and day . his majesty now spent much of his time in writing poems , telling her of his love and devotion , and sent them to her , and though she refused to see him again she answered with many verses of her own composing , which told him gently and kindly that she could never marry any one on this earth . these little songs always gave him pleasure . at this time her foster - parents noticed that night after night the princess would sit on her balcony and gaze for hours at the moon , in a spirit of the deepest dejection , ending always in a burst of tears . one night the old man found her thus weeping as if her heart were broken , and he besought her to tell him the reason of her sorrow .
her friends from the moon would come fetch her and she would have to return . <SEP> with many tears she told him that he had guessed rightly when he supposed her not to belong to this world - that she had in truth come from the moon , and that her time on earth would soon be over . on the fifteenth day of that very month of august her friends from the moon would come to fetch her , and she would have to return . her parents were both there , but having spent a lifetime on the earth she had forgotten them , and also the moon - world to which she belonged . it made her weep , she said , to think of leaving her kind foster - parents , and the home where she had been happy for so long . when her attendants heard this they were very sad , and could not eat or drink for sadness at the thought that the princess was so soon to leave them . the emperor , as soon as the news was carried to him , sent messengers to the house to find out if the report were true or not .
to think of leaving her kind foster - parents and the home where she had been happy for so long . <SEP> with many tears she told him that he had guessed rightly when he supposed her not to belong to this world - that she had in truth come from the moon , and that her time on earth would soon be over . on the fifteenth day of that very month of august her friends from the moon would come to fetch her , and she would have to return . her parents were both there , but having spent a lifetime on the earth she had forgotten them , and also the moon - world to which she belonged . it made her weep , she said , to think of leaving her kind foster - parents , and the home where she had been happy for so long . when her attendants heard this they were very sad , and could not eat or drink for sadness at the thought that the princess was so soon to leave them . the emperor , as soon as the news was carried to him , sent messengers to the house to find out if the report were true or not .
he was sad his daughter was leaving . <SEP> with many tears she told him that he had guessed rightly when he supposed her not to belong to this world - that she had in truth come from the moon , and that her time on earth would soon be over . on the fifteenth day of that very month of august her friends from the moon would come to fetch her , and she would have to return . her parents were both there , but having spent a lifetime on the earth she had forgotten them , and also the moon - world to which she belonged . it made her weep , she said , to think of leaving her kind foster - parents , and the home where she had been happy for so long . when her attendants heard this they were very sad , and could not eat or drink for sadness at the thought that the princess was so soon to leave them . the emperor , as soon as the news was carried to him , sent messengers to the house to find out if the report were true or not . the old bamboo - cutter went out to meet the imperial messengers . the last few days of sorrow had told upon the old man ; he had aged greatly , and looked much more than his seventy years . weeping bitterly , he told them that the report was only too true , but he intended , however , to make prisoners of the envoys from the moon , and to do all he could to prevent the princess from being carried back . the men returned and told his majesty all that had passed . on the fifteenth day of that month the emperor sent a guard of two thousand warriors to watch the house . one thousand stationed themselves on the roof , another thousand kept watch round all the entrances of the house . all were well trained archers , with bows and arrows . the bamboo - cutter and his wife hid princess moonlight in an inner room .
make prisoners of the envoys from the moon . <SEP> the old bamboo - cutter went out to meet the imperial messengers . the last few days of sorrow had told upon the old man ; he had aged greatly , and looked much more than his seventy years . weeping bitterly , he told them that the report was only too true , but he intended , however , to make prisoners of the envoys from the moon , and to do all he could to prevent the princess from being carried back . the men returned and told his majesty all that had passed . on the fifteenth day of that month the emperor sent a guard of two thousand warriors to watch the house . one thousand stationed themselves on the roof , another thousand kept watch round all the entrances of the house . all were well trained archers , with bows and arrows . the bamboo - cutter and his wife hid princess moonlight in an inner room .
nothing could prevent them from carrying out their purpose . <SEP> the old man gave orders that no one was to sleep that night , all in the house were to keep a strict watch , and be ready to protect the princess . with these precautions , and the help of the emperor 's men - at - arms , he hoped to withstand the moon - messengers , but the princess told him that all these measures to keep her would be useless , and that when her people came for her nothing whatever could prevent them from carrying out their purpose . even the emperors men would be powerless . then she added with tears that she was very , very sorry to leave him and his wife , whom she had learned to love as her parents , that if she could do as she liked she would stay with them in their old age , and try to make some return for all the love and kindness they had showered upon her during all her earthly life . the night wore on ! the yellow harvest moon rose high in the heavens , flooding the world asleep with her golden light . silence reigned over the pine and the bamboo forests , and on the roof where the thousand men - at - arms waited .
a band of luminous beings . <SEP> then the night grew gray towards the dawn and all hoped that the danger was over - that princess moonlight would not have to leave them after all . then suddenly the watchers saw a cloud form round the moon - and while they looked this cloud began to roll earthwards . nearer and nearer it came , and every one saw with dismay that its course lay towards the house . in a short time the sky was entirely obscured , till at last the cloud lay over the dwelling only ten feet off the ground . in the midst of the cloud there stood a flying chariot , and in the chariot a band of luminous beings . one amongst them who looked like a king and appeared to be the chief stepped out of the chariot , and , poised in air , called to the old man to come out .
the chief . <SEP> " the time has come , " he said , " for princess moonlight to return to the moon from whence she came . she committed a grave fault , and as a punishment was sent to live down here for a time . we know what good care you have taken of the princess , and we have rewarded you for this and have sent you wealth and prosperity . we put the gold in the bamboos for you to find . " " i have brought up this princess for twenty years and never once has she done a wrong thing , therefore the lady you are seeking can not be this one , " said the old man . " i pray you to look elsewhere . " then the messenger called aloud , saying : " princess moonlight , come out from this lowly dwelling . rest not here another moment . "
barbaik bourhis . <SEP> in the old land of brittany , once called cornwall , there lived a woman named barbaik bourhis , who spent all her days in looking after her farm with the help of her niece tephany . early and late the two might be seen in the fields or in the dairy , milking cows , making butter , feeding fowls ; working hard themselves and taking care that others worked too . perhaps it might have been better for barbaik if she had left herself a little time to rest and to think about other things , for soon she grew to love money for its own sake , and only gave herself and tephany the food and clothes they absolutely needed . and as for poor people she positively hated them , and declared that such lazy creatures had no business in the world .

young denis . <SEP> well , this being the sort of person barbaik was , it is easy to guess at her anger when one day she found tephany talking outside the cowhouse to young denis , who was nothing more than a day labourer from the village of plover . seizing her niece by the arm , she pulled her sharply away , exclaiming : ' are you not ashamed , girl , to waste your time over a man who is as poor as a rat , when there are a dozen more who would be only too happy to buy you rings of silver , if you would let them ?

a little old woman . <SEP> tephany did not dare to disobey , but with a heavy heart went down the path to the river .
